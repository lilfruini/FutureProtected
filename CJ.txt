CJ|0|0|1|1|ï»¿THE LORD'S FOREWORD
CJ|0|0|1|0|I LIVED IN THAT WELL-KNOWN TIME up to My thirtieth year just like any other properly raised boy, then young man and then man, and first had to awaken the Deity within Me - just as every man must awaken Me within himself - by conforming My earthly way of life to the Law of Moses.
CJ|0|0|2|0|Just like any other responsible person, I first had to awaken My faith in the existence of God and comprehend Him ever more and more through all manner of self-denial as well as ever increasing love until by degrees I finally achieved complete control of the divine Power.
CJ|0|0|3|0|Thus I, as the Lord Myself, was a living example for every man, wherefore every man can now draw Me to himself just as I Myself put on the divine Nature within Me, and of his own free will can become just as wholly one with Me by his love and by his faith as I Myself as part man and part God am wholly one with the divine Essence in all infinite fullness.
CJ|0|0|4|0|2. TO THE QUESTION as to how the Child-wonders of Jesus and His divinely-spiritual activity as a Child may be correlated to His as it were isolated human nature during adolescence and manhood and again to His at that time performed wonders - if one is to think of Him in these (isolated) years as only a human being - a look at a tree from spring to fall serves as an answer.
CJ|0|0|5|0|In the springtime the tree blossoms wondrously and is alive with activity. After the blossoms have fallen the tree again seems to be inactive. But towards fall the tree reemerges in its greatest activity: the fruits, the surely wondrous, are flavored - and colored more beautifully than formerly the blossoms - and thus ripened, and the blessing bestowed on them is freed of its bonds and falls as such into the lap of the hungry little children.
CJ|0|0|6|0|This parable may be discerned with the eye of the heart, but never with the eye of worldly wisdom. The passages open to question are quite readily discerned - if the Deity of Jesus is not denied but is upheld by the faith of the heart, which is a light of love toward God ... For as soon as the heart of man becomes pure it easily understands that the complete union of the fullness of the Deity with the man Jesus was not consummated at one time, as if in an instant but, like all things under the guidance of God, only progressively, like the gradual (successive) awakening of the divine spirit in the human heart. And this consummation was fully achieved only through His death on the cross - although the Deity in all Its fullness already dwelt in the Child Jesus, but made Itself manifest in wondrous works only in time of need.
CJ|0|0|7|0|3. THE TEMPORAL DEATH OF JESUS is the utmost condescension of the Deity into the judgment of all matter and therewith makes possible an entirely new establishment of relations between Creator and creature.
CJ|0|0|8|0|Only through the death of Jesus does God Himself become altogether man and created man by means of this divine, supreme grace a newly conceived child of God - that is, a God - and only thus as the Creator's perfected likeness can the created being stand face to face with Him and see, speak, recognize and beyond measure love Him as its God, Creator and Father, and only thus gain the perfect eternal, indestructible life in God, from God and beside God ... And therewith the power (that is: will) of Satan is broken to the extent that he no longer can prevent the full approach of the Deity to the children of men, and conversely their approach to the Deity.
CJ|0|0|9|0|To say it more briefly: Through the death of Jesus every man now can fraternize with God in fullest measure, and never again can Satan intervene - for which reason the word to the women visiting the grave states: Go and tell it to My brothers! - The rule of Satan in the outer form may well be constantly discerned, but eternally never again can he restore the once torn curtain between the Deity and mankind and thus rebuild the old impassable gulf between God and mankind.
CJ|0|0|10|0|And from this brief exposition of the subject every man who thinks and sees with his heart can very easily and clearly appreciate the boundless gain inherent in the temporal death of Jesus. Amen.
CJ|0|0|11|1|From the Time that Joseph Took Mary into His House
CJ|0|0|11|0|JAMES, A SON OF JOSEPH, originally made this record, which in time was so greatly distorted that it could not be accepted as authentic for the Scripture. I will now give you the original Gospel of James, but beginning only with the above-mentioned time, for James had also included Mary's biography from her birth as well as that of Joseph. So then write as the first chapter:
CJ|0|1|1|1|Joseph Takes Mary Into His House
CJ|0|1|1|0|JOSEPH was building a house in the country between Nazareth and Jerusalem.
CJ|0|1|2|0|A distinguished citizen of Jerusalem was having this house built there to serve as an inn, for the Nazarenes had no shelter all the way to Jerusalem.
CJ|0|1|3|0|AND MARY, who was brought up in the temple, had matured, and the Law of Moses required that she be given from the temple.
CJ|0|1|4|0|Messengers were therefore sent into all of Judea with these tidings to summon the fathers - that if one were found worthy, he was to take the maiden into his house.
CJ|0|1|5|0|When these tidings reached Joseph, he quickly laid his axe aside and hastened to Jerusalem and there to the designated meeting and council chamber in the temple.
CJ|0|1|6|0|Three days later the applicants again met in the same chamber, and each candidate for Mary handed a fresh lily stalk to the priest as previously determined upon. The priest then went into the sanctuary of the temple with the stalks and there prayed.
CJ|0|1|7|0|When he had completed his prayer, he came out with the stalks and returned to each his stalk.
CJ|0|1|8|0|All of the stalks thereupon became spotted - only the one last given to Joseph remained fresh and unblemished.
CJ|0|1|9|0|But a few began to Find fault at this and said that this test favored Joseph, was therefore not binding and requested another test which would be above reproach.
CJ|0|1|10|0|The priest, somewhat provoked at this, immediately had Mary sent for, handed her a dove and told her to walk into the center of the candidates, there to let the dove fly free.
CJ|0|1|11|0|And before ordering the dove freed, he said to the candidates, 'Behold, you false interpreters of the sign of Jehovah! This dove is a pure, innocent creature and has no ear for our discussion,
CJ|0|1|12|0|for it lives only in the will of the Lord and understands only the almighty language of God.
CJ|0|1|13|0|Hold high your stalks! - Upon whose stalk this dove settles, once it has been freed by this maiden, and upon whose head it will sit, he shall take Mary!'
CJ|0|1|14|0|With this the candidates were satisfied and agreed, 'Even so, this shall be a sure sign!'
CJ|0|1|15|0|And when Mary freed the dove at the word of the priest, it promptly flew over to Joseph, settled on his stalk and thereupon on Joseph's head.
CJ|0|1|16|0|Here the priest declared, 'Thus has the Lord willed it! Upon you, oh worthy craftsman, is fallen the unerring lot for the maiden of the Lord! Take her in the name of the Lord into your unblemished house for future care. Amen.'
CJ|0|1|17|0|When Joseph heard this, he appealed to the priest, saying, 'Hear me, oh anointed servant of the Lord according to the Law of Moses, the faithful servant of the Lord God Zebaoth - I am already an old man with grown-up sons at home and have been a widower for a long time. I shall become an object of ridicule before the sons of Israel if I take this little maiden into my house.
CJ|0|1|18|0|Therefore let the choice be taken once more and let me stand aside, so I will not be counted among the candidates.'
CJ|0|1|19|0|Here the priest raised his hand and warned, 'Joseph - fear the Lord God! Do you not know what He did to Dathan, to Korah and to Abiram?
CJ|0|1|20|0|Behold, the earth opened up and all were swallowed by her because of their obstinacy! Do you suppose that He could not do the same to you?
CJ|0|1|21|0|I tell you, now that you have seen and recognized the unerring sign of Jehovah, do therefore obey the Lord who is almighty and just and always chastens the obstinate and the deserters of His will!
CJ|0|1|22|0|But otherwise be greatly afraid for your house, whether the Lord will not also visit upon your house what He visited upon Dathan, Korah and Abiram.'
CJ|0|1|23|0|At this Joseph was filled with dread, and he said to the priest in great fear, 'So then pray for me, that the Lord may once more be gracious and merciful toward me, and then give me the maiden according to His will.'
CJ|0|1|24|0|The priest now went inside and prayed for Joseph before the Holy of Holies, and the Lord spoke to the there praying priest:
CJ|0|1|25|0|'Do not trouble Me the man whom I have chosen - for more justly than he walks none in Israel, and none on the whole earth, and none before My throne in  all the heavens!
CJ|0|1|26|0|Now go out and give the maiden, whom I have raised Myself, to the most righteous of men on the earth.'
CJ|0|1|27|0|And the priest smote his breast and exclaimed, 'O Lord, almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, be merciful to me a sinner before You, for now I know that You will judge Your people!'
CJ|0|1|28|0|Thereupon the priest arose, went out and with a blessing in the name of the Lord gave the maiden to the affrightened Joseph
CJ|0|1|29|0|and said to him, 'Joseph, you are found just before the Lord, therefore He has chosen you from among many thousands. Go in peace. Amen.'
CJ|0|1|30|0|Here Joseph took Mary and said, 'May the alone holy will of My Lord and my God always be done! What You, O Lord, give, is always good - therefore I gladly and most willingly take this gift from Your hand. Now bless her for me and me for her, so I may be worthy of her before You now, as always.  Your will be done, amen.'
CJ|0|1|31|0|When Joseph had said this before the Lord he was lifted up in his heart, then went out of the temple with Mary and led her into the land of Nazareth and there into his humble dwelling.
CJ|0|1|32|0|Much work awaited Joseph, so he wasted no time at home and accordingly said to Mary,
CJ|0|1|33|0|'See, Mary, I have taken you into my home from the temple of the Lord, my God, according to His will. But I cannot remain with you now to protect you, for I must fulfill my contract to complete the house I showed you on our trip here.
CJ|0|1|34|0|But be assured that you will not be left at home alone. For I have a closely related housekeeper who is devout and just - she and my youngest son will be with you, and the grace of the Lord and His blessing will not leave you.
CJ|0|1|35|0|In a short time I and my four sons will return to you, and I shall be your guide in the ways of the Lord. The Lord God will now watch over you and my house, amen.'
CJ|0|2|1|1|Mary Spins For The New Temple Curtain
CJ|0|2|1|0|AT THAT TIME another curtain was needed in the temple, since the old one had become greatly worn here and there and needed to be covered.
CJ|0|2|2|0|A council was therefore held by the priests, and they said, 'Let us make a curtain in the temple of the Lord as a cover for the damaged one.
CJ|0|2|3|0|For the Lord may well come today or tomorrow, as it is written - how would we appear before Him if He found the temple thus neglected by us?'
CJ|0|2|4|0|Here the high priest said, 'Do not use such blind judgment, as if the Lord, whose sanctuary is in the temple, did not know how matters now stand in the temple.
CJ|0|2|5|0|Just the same, call me seven spotless maidens from the tribe of David, and we will draw lots to decide how the work is to be assigned.'
CJ|0|2|6|0|The attendants now went forth to seek the maidens from the tribe of David. After much searching only six were found available to the high priest.
CJ|0|2|7|0|The high priest then remembered that Mary, who only a few weeks before had been placed in Joseph's care, was also from the tribe of David, and quickly informed the attendants of this.
CJ|0|2|8|0|Hereupon the attendants went forth and notified Joseph, and he brought Mary into the temple again, led by the temple attendants.
CJ|0|2|9|0|When the maidens were gathered in the antechamber, the high priest came and led them all into the temple of the Lord.
CJ|0|2|10|0|And while they were thus assembled, he addressed them as follows,
CJ|0|2|11|0|'Hear, oh maidens from the tribe of David, who according to the will of the Lord has ordained that the fine work on the curtain which divides the most holy tabernacle from the rest of the temple shall always be prepared by the maidens of his tribe,
CJ|0|2|12|0|and according to his testament the manifold work shall be distributed by lot, and each maiden according to her skill shall best prepare the work fallen to her.
CJ|0|2|13|0|Behold, there before you is the damaged curtain, and here upon the golden table lie the various raw stuffs already prepared for use.
CJ|0|2|14|0|You can see that this work is pressing, therefore draw lots promptly so we can see which of you shall spin the gold thread, the asbestos and the cotton thread,
CJ|0|2|15|0|the silk thread, the hyacinth-colored, the scarlet and the genuine purple!'
CJ|0|2|16|0|Thereupon the maidens meekly drew lots while the high priest prayed over them, and when they had drawn lots according to the prescribed order, it was determined how the work should be apportioned.
CJ|0|2|17|0|And to the maiden Mary, the daughter of Anna and Joachim, there fell by lot the scarlet and the genuine purple.
CJ|0|2|18|0|At this the maiden thanked God for such gracious recognition and apportionment of such distinguished labor in His honor, took the work and with it went home again, led by Joseph.
CJ|0|2|19|0|Arrived at home, Mary promptly began her work in a joyful mood, while Joseph commended her to all diligence, blessed her and then went right back to his house-building.
CJ|0|2|20|0|This took place at the same time that Zacharias, when he was appointed to make the smoke offering in the temple, lost his speech because of a small wavering in his faith, wherefore another had been chosen in his stead by whom this work was allotted.
CJ|0|2|21|0|Mary was related to Zacharias as well as to his proxy, wherefore she doubly increased her diligence that she might if possible be the first to finish her work.
CJ|0|2|22|0|Now she did not double her zeal out of a desire for praise, but only because she wanted to give the Lord God a real pleasure by completing her work as promptly and skillfully as possible.
CJ|0|2|23|0|First came the work on the scarlet, which needed to be woven with great concentration so the thread would not here or there be thicker or thinner.
CJ|0|2|24|0|With great mastery the scarlet thread was spun by Mary so that all who came to Joseph's house were greatly impressed by Mary's exceptional skill.
CJ|0|2|25|0|In the short space of three days Mary was finished with the scarlet and at once turned to the purple; but since this constantly needed to be moistened, she frequently while working had to take her jug and go out to get herself water.
CJ|0|3|1|1|The Annunciation
CJ|0|3|1|0|ON A FRIDAY MORNING Mary again took the water jug and went out to fill it with water, when lo, - a voice said to her,
CJ|0|3|2|0|'Greetings to you, rich in the grace of the Lord! The Lord is with you, oh consecrated among women!'
CJ|0|3|3|0|Mary was greatly frightened at such voice, for she did not know whence it came and therefore looked nimbly about to the right and left - but she could discover no one  who  might  have spoken.
CJ|0|3|4|0|She therefore was seized with still more tormenting fear, hastily took the filled water jug and hurried away into the house.
CJ|0|3|5|0|Quakingly arrived there, she quickly set the water jug aside, again took the purple in hand, sat down on her workstool and recommenced to spin the purple quite industriously.
CJ|0|3|6|0|But hardly had she fully reaccustomed herself to her work, when behold, there before the busy maiden stood the angel of the Lord and said to her:
CJ|0|3|7|0|'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found infinitely great favor before the face of the Lord. Behold, you will become pregnant by the Word of God!'
CJ|0|3|8|0|When Mary heard this, she began to weigh these words back and forth and could not grasp their meaning, wherefore she said to the angel,
CJ|0|3|9|0|'But how shall that take place? For I am still a long way from being a man's wife and also have never made the acquaintance of any man, who then might take me as his wife, so I might become pregnant like other women and bear child as they do!'
CJ|0|3|10|0|And the angel said to Mary: 'Hear, you chosen maiden of God! It shall not happen in that manner, but the power of the Lord will overshadow you.
CJ|0|3|11|0|Therefore that holy Thing which will be born of you will be called: the Son of the Almighty!
CJ|0|3|12|0|And when He is born, you shall give Him the name: Jesus - for He will redeem His people from all sins, from judgment and from eternal death.'
CJ|0|3|13|0|Here Mary fell down before the angel and said, 'Behold, I am only a handmaiden of the Lord; so let it be done to me according to His will, as made known by your words!' Hereupon the angel disappeared, and Mary returned to her work.
CJ|0|4|1|1|Mary Entreats The Lord For Grace
CJ|0|4|1|0|WHEN THE ANGEL had disappeared, Mary praised and glorified the Lord God and spoke in her heart,
CJ|0|4|2|0|'Oh what am I before You, O Lord, that You should show me such grace?
CJ|0|4|3|0|I shall become pregnant without ever having known a man, for I just do not know what difference there is between me and a man.
CJ|0|4|4|0|'Do I really know what it is to be pregnant? - O Lord, see, I just do not know.
CJ|0|4|5|0|Do I know what is meant when people say: A woman gives birth? - O Lord, look upon me graciously. I am just a maiden of fourteen years, and have only heard speak of that - and actually know nothing about it.
CJ|0|4|6|0|Oh, what will happen to me when I shall become pregnant - and do not know how such a condition is!
CJ|0|4|7|0|What will father Joseph say to that, so I shall tell him, or will he notice that I am pregnant?
CJ|0|4|8|0|'But being pregnant cannot be anything bad, especially when a handmaiden of the Lord, as once Sarah, is chosen for that by the Lord Himself!
CJ|0|4|9|0|For I have heard it said a number of times in the temple, what great joy the women have when they are with child.
CJ|0|4|10|0|Therefore pregnancy must be something quite good and highly blessed and I shall also rejoice when it is given me of God that I shall conceive!
CJ|0|4|11|0|'But when, when will this be and how? Or has it happened already? Have I already conceived, or is this still to happen?
CJ|0|4|12|0|O Lord, You eternally Holy One of Israel, do give me, Your poor handmaiden, a sign when such shall happen so I might exalt and praise You!'
CJ|0|4|13|0|At these words Mary felt a light breath of air and a very gentle voice said to her,
CJ|0|4|14|0|'Mary, do not concern yourself vainly; you have conceived, and the Lord is with you! Go to your work and complete it, for henceforth no more work of this kind will done for the temple.'
CJ|0|4|15|0|Hereupon Mary fell down, prayed to God and praised and exalted Him for such grace. And when she had offered her praise to the Lord, she arose and returned to her work.
CJ|0|5|1|1|A Prophecy Of The High Priest
CJ|0|5|1|0|IN A FEW DAYS Mary also Finished the purple, folded it and laid it with the scarlet.
CJ|0|5|2|0|She then thanked God for His grace, in that He had allowed her to complete her work so well, wrapped the spinning in clean linens and travelled therewith toward Jerusalem.
CJ|0|5|3|0|She went alone to the house which Joseph was building; but from there on Joseph again accompanied her to Jerusalem and there into the temple.
CJ|0|5|4|0|Upon arrival Mary promptly turned the work over to the high priest.
CJ|0|5|5|0|He well examined the scarlet and the purple, found the work to be of the most excellent quality and greeted and praised Mary for it with the following words,
CJ|0|5|6|0|'Mary, you did not have such skill naturally, but the Lord has guided you with His hand!
CJ|0|5|7|0|Great has the Lord therefore made you, blessed shall you be among all women of the earth from the Lord God, for you are now the first who has delivered her work to the Lord in the temple!'
CJ|0|5|8|0|Here Mary, Filled with joy and humility in her heart, said to the priest,
CJ|0|5|9|0|'Worthy servant of the Lord in His sanctuary! Oh do not praise me too much nor place me above the others - for this work is not really of my merit but only of the Lord who guided my hand.
CJ|0|5|10|0|Therefore to Him alone be all praise, all honor, all my love and all my worship without ceasing!'
CJ|0|5|11|0|And the high priest responded, 'Amen, Mary, you pure maiden of the Lord, you have spoken well before Him. Go your way now in peace; the Lord be with you.'
CJ|0|5|12|0|Thereupon Mary arose and returned with Joseph to the building site, where she refreshed herself with bread and milk.
CJ|0|5|13|0|Now by a half day's journey from the building site, across a small mountain range, there lived an aunt of Mary's named Elizabeth, whom she wanted to visit and therefore asked Joseph for his permission.
CJ|0|5|14|0|And Joseph promptly consented and sent along his oldest son as a guide, who was to accompany her until she could see Elizabeth's house.
CJ|0|6|1|1|Mary Discourses On The Just Life
CJ|0|6|1|0|ARRIVED AT Elizabeth's house in a timid frame of mind, Mary knocked on the door according to Jewish custom.
CJ|0|6|2|0|When Elizabeth heard the timid knocking she thought to herself, 'Now who knocks there so very lightly?
CJ|0|6|3|0|It probably is my neighbor's child, for it cannot be my husband who is still mute in the temple and awaits deliverance.
CJ|0|6|4|0|My work is important - should I put it aside for a prankish child?
CJ|0|6|5|0|No, that I shall not do, for it is a work for the temple which is more important than the prank of a child which has nothing else in mind, as I know from the past, than to tease and mock me.
CJ|0|6|6|0|Therefore I shall stay right with my work and let the child knock good and long.'
CJ|0|6|7|0|Here Mary knocked once more, and the child in Elizabeth's body began to leap with joy, and the mother heard a gentle voice from the direction of the child leaping  within   her,   saying,
CJ|0|6|8|0|'Mother, go, go very quickly, for it is the mother of my and your Lord, of my and your God, who knocks there on the door and  visits  you  in  peace!'
CJ|0|6|9|0|When Elizabeth heard this, she instantly cast everything she had in her hands from her, ran and opened the door for Mary,
CJ|0|6|10|0|quickly gave her her blessing according to custom, then embraced her with open arms and exclaimed,
CJ|0|6|11|0|'Oh Mary, blessed among women - you are blessed among all women, and blessed is the fruit of your body!
CJ|0|6|12|0|Oh Mary, purest maiden of God - how can I deserve such high grace, that the mother of my Lord and My God should visit me?'
CJ|0|6|13|0|At this Mary, who did not understand such mysterious words, inquired of Elizabeth,
CJ|0|6|14|0|'But dear aunt, I just came to you for a friendly visit! What things are you saying about me which I do not understand? Am I then already pregnant, that you call me a mother?'
CJ|0|6|15|0|And Elizabeth answered, 'See, when you knocked on the door the second time, the wee child which I am carrying under my heart leaped for joy, told me this and greeted you from within me in advance!'
CJ|0|6|16|0|Here Mary looked up to heaven and recalled what the archangel Gabriel had spoken to her, although she still did not understand it, and said,
CJ|0|6|17|0|'O You great God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, what have You done with me? What after all am I, that all generations of the earth should call me blessed?'
CJ|0|6|18|0|Elizabeth said, 'Oh Mary, you chosen one of God, step into my house and refresh yourself - there we will talk and together praise and glorify God with all our might!'
CJ|0|6|19|0|At this Mary followed Elizabeth into her house, ate and drank, refreshed herself and was full of good cheer.
CJ|0|6|20|0|Elizabeth now inquired of Mary about the many things she had learned during her stay in the temple as a ward of the Lord and how it all had impressed her.
CJ|0|6|21|0|And Mary replied, 'Dear aunt, ever so well blessed of the Lord! I believe that these matters are beyond our understanding, and we women would be unwise to deliberate on matters with which the Lord has charged the sons of Aaron.
CJ|0|6|22|0|So I would say that we women should leave the matters of God to Him and to those whom He has given charge over them, and should not speculate about them.
CJ|0|6|23|0|If we just love God above all and keep His holy commandments, we then live wholly according to our station; anything beyond that belongs of right to those men whom the Lord calls and elects.
CJ|0|6|24|0|I would say, dear aunt, that is right, so excuse me from vain gossip about the temple - for it will not get better or worse from it. When the Lord decides, He will surely chasten and reform the temple at the proper time.'
CJ|0|6|25|0|Elizabeth recognized Mary's modesty and deep humility in these words and agreed,
CJ|0|6|26|0|'Yes, oh maiden filled with God's grace! With such sentiments one must surely find the highest grace before God.
CJ|0|6|27|0|For as you now speak, only purest innocence can speak, and whoever lives according to that, surely lives justly before God and the whole world.'
CJ|0|6|28|0|And Mary said: 'The just life is not ours, but the Lord's, and is of His grace.
CJ|0|6|29|0|Whoever believes that he lives justly, he is surely the least just before God - but he who always confesses his guilt before God, he it is who lives justly before God.
CJ|0|6|30|0|I do not know how I live - my life is wholly a grace of the Lord; so I can do nothing else than to love, praise and exalt Him with all my might! Is your life like mine, then do the same, and the Lord will be more pleased with that, than if we should talk ever so much about the business of the temple.'
CJ|0|6|31|0|Elizabeth discerned only too well that a divine spirit emanated from Mary, therefore ceased her questions about the temple and resigned  herself,   praising  and glorifying God,  into  His will.
CJ|0|6|32|0|Thus Mary spent three whole months with Elizabeth and helped her like a maid-servant in performing all housework.
CJ|0|6|33|0|In the meantime Joseph had completed his building, was at home again with his four sons and looked after his small piece of land, which he only leased.
CJ|0|6|34|0|And one evening Joseph said to his oldest son, 'Joel, go and prepare me my pack animal, for tomorrow morning I must go and get Mary.
CJ|0|6|35|0|The girl is already out of my house by three months, and I do not know what goes on with her.
CJ|0|6|36|0|For although she is with the wife of the high priest who is become mute, still one cannot know whether this house is free from all temptation of him who enticed Eve.
CJ|0|6|37|0|Therefore I will journey there tomorrow and bring the girl back, lest in time the sons of Israel speak ill of me and and the Lord chastise me for lack of concern for the girl.'
CJ|0|6|38|0|And Joel did according to Joseph's words; but hardly had Joel Finished his work, when behold, Mary already stood before the entrance, greeted Joseph and asked to be taken into his house again.
CJ|0|6|39|0|Joseph, quite astonished at Mary's appearance, promptly asked, 'Is it really you, oh unfaithful one to my house?'
CJ|0|6|40|0|And Mary answered, 'Yes, it is I - but not unfaithful to your house, for I would gladly have been back here long ago, but I did not trust myself to cross the wooded highlands alone - and then you sent no messenger for me! So I just had to stay away for so long!
CJ|0|6|41|0|Then three Levites visited Zacharias' wife, and when they returned home to Jerusalem they took me along with them and brought me to the boundary of your land, blessed me and your house and then went their way, and I hurried here to you again, my dear father Joseph.'
CJ|0|6|42|0|While Joseph at first would have liked to scold Mary a little for her long absence, he did not have the heart to do so; for one thing Mary's voice had touched his noble heart too strongly, and then he felt himself to be the guilty one, since he had not sent a messenger for Mary for so long.
CJ|0|6|43|0|He therefore let the girl come to him so he might bless her, and the girl sprang to Joseph and caressed him like innocent little children caress their parents and other benefactors.
CJ|0|6|44|0|Joseph was quite moved by this, was filled with great happiness and said, 'See, I am a poor man and stricken in years, but your childlike love makes me forget my poverty and my age! The Lord has given you to me to be a great joy, therefore I will go and labor with joy so I may provide you, my dear little child, with a good piece of bread.'
CJ|0|6|45|0|At these words the tears fell from the old man's eyes. Here Mary quickly dried his moist cheeks and thanked God for giving her such a good foster-father. -
CJ|0|6|46|0|And at that time it suddenly seemed to Joseph as if psalms were being sung in front of His house.
CJ|0|7|1|1|Joseph Notices Mary's Pregnancy
CJ|0|7|1|0|JOSEPH WAS filled with high presentiments and said to Mary, 'Child of the Lord! Much joy is given my house in you, my soul is filled with high presentiments!
CJ|0|7|2|0|But I also know that the Lord always painfully afflicts those He loves, so let us always ask Him to be gracious and merciful to us all.
CJ|0|7|3|0|It is even possible that the Lord will want to have the old Ark of the Covenant renewed through you and me.
CJ|0|7|4|0|Should something like that be in the offing, then woe to me and you, for we will have to withstand a very difficult task there. But no more of that now.
CJ|0|7|5|0|What must happen surely will happen and we will not be able to prevent it, but when it comes it will seize us with an all-powerful hand, and we will tremble before the will of Him who set the foundations of the earth!'
CJ|0|7|6|0|Mary understood nothing of all this and soothed the very troubled-looking Joseph with these words,
CJ|0|7|7|0|'Dear father Joseph! Do not be saddened at the Lord's will, for we know that He always wants only the best for His children! If the Lord is with us, as He was with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and as He always was with those who loved him, what harm and evil can possibly befall us?'
CJ|0|7|8|0|Joseph was satisfied with this consolation, thanked the Lord in his heart with all his might that He had given him such a comforting angel in Mary, and then said,
CJ|0|7|9|0|'Children, it is already late in the evening, so let us intone the hymn of praise, partake of our blessed evening meal and then retire.'
CJ|0|7|10|0|The hymn was sung, whereupon Mary quickly brought the bread and Joseph apportioned it and all marveled that the bread this time tasted so exceptionally good.
CJ|0|7|11|0|Here Joseph said, 'All praise to the Lord! What He blesses always tastes well and has the best flavor.'
CJ|0|7|12|0|And Mary said to Joseph in a lovingly wise manner, 'See, dear father, therefore you should not fear the visitations of the Lord, for they truly are also His ever so precious blessings.'
CJ|0|7|13|0|And Joseph agreed, 'Yes, yes, you pure daughter of the Lord, you are right! I will indeed be glad to bear in all patience whatever the Lord gives me to carry. He surely will not make His burden too heavy for me nor His yoke too hard - for He is truly a father full of kindness and mercy even in His zeal. May His holy will always be done!'
CJ|0|7|14|0|Hereupon the devout family went to rest and worked at home the next few days.
CJ|0|7|15|0|In the meantime Mary's body became fuller day by day, and since she was well aware of this, she attempted to hide her pregnancy from the eyes of Joseph and his sons as well as she could.
CJ|0|7|16|0|But after a time of two months her concealment helped her no more, and Joseph became suspicious and secretly consulted one of his friends in Nazareth concerning Mary's strange condition.
CJ|0|8|1|1|Joseph Questions Mary
CJ|0|8|1|0|JOSEPH'S FRIEND was an expert, for he was a doctor familiar with the herbs who not infrequently stood by the mid-wives in times of critical births.
CJ|0|8|2|0|He went with Joseph and secretly looked at Mary; and when he had viewed her he said to Joseph,
CJ|0|8|3|0|'Listen to me, brother from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! A great misfortune has befallen your house, for the maiden is highly pregnant!
CJ|0|8|4|0|Now you are to blame for that yourself! See, it is already the sixth month since you have been away with your house-building. Tell me, who could then have well looked after the maiden?'
CJ|0|8|5|0|Joseph answered, 'See, during that time Mary was home alone only three weeks and that in the beginning when she came into my house. Then she spent three whole months with her aunt Elizabeth.
CJ|0|8|6|0|By now it is two months that she has constantly been under my care, and I have never seen anyone who might have gone to her openly or in secret.
CJ|0|8|7|0|And while I was gone she was anyhow in the best of hands - my son, who led her to Elizabeth, first gave me his most solemn vow that except in an emergency, he would not touch even her garment during the whole trip.
CJ|0|8|8|0|Therefore I know with great certainty that Mary must be perfectly clean as far as my house is concerned; but whether such is also the case with the house of Zacharias is another question.
CJ|0|8|9|0|Could that possibly have happened to her in the temple by one of its servants? May the Lord preserve me from such an opinion, for He would have exposed that long ago by the constant wisdom of the high priest!
CJ|0|8|10|0|But I know now what I shall do to get at the truth of the matter! - You, friend, may go again in peace, and I shall subject my house to a strict examination.'
CJ|0|8|11|0|Joseph's friend soon departed, whereupon Joseph promptly turned to Mary and demanded:
CJ|0|8|12|0|'Child, with what countenance shall I now look up to my God? What shall I say about you now?
CJ|0|8|13|0|Did I not receive you from the temple as a pure maiden, and did I not faithfully protect you by my daily prayer and by the faithful who are in my house?
CJ|0|8|14|0|I adjure you therefore to tell me who it is that has dared to deceive me and to so shamefully profane himself against me, a son of David, and against you, who are also come forth from the same house.
CJ|0|8|15|0|Who has seduced and defiled you, a maiden of the Lord? Who has managed to so becloud your purest inclination - and who was it that made of you a second Eve?
CJ|0|8|16|0|Why, in this the old story of Adam repeats itself with me in the flesh, for you have obviously been deluded by a serpent just like Eve was.
CJ|0|8|17|0|Now answer me my question. But see that you collect yourself, for you shall not succeed in deceiving me!' Here Joseph in his grief threw himself on his face on a sack filled with ashes and wept.
CJ|0|8|18|0|And Mary trembled from great fright, began to weep and sob and could not speak in her great dread and sorrow.
CJ|0|8|19|0|Here Joseph raised himself up from the sack and asked Mary in a somewhat moderate tone,
CJ|0|8|20|0|'Mary, child of God, whom He Himself has taken into His care, why did you do this to me? Why did you degrade your soul so greatly and forget your God?
CJ|0|8|21|0|How could you do this, you who were raised in the Holy of Holies and received your food from the hand of the angels and always had these shining servants of God as your playmates? Oh, speak, and do not be silent with me!'
CJ|0|8|22|0|Here Mary took courage and replied, 'Father Joseph, you just, hard man! I say to you, as truly as God lives, that truly am I clean and innocent and have never had anything to do with any man!'
CJ|0|8|23|0|At this Joseph asked, 'From whence then is That which you carry under your heart?'
CJ|0|8|24|0|And Mary answered, 'See, I am still only a child and do not understand the secrets of God! But listen, and I will tell you what happened to me. - And that is surely as true as there lives a just God above us!'
CJ|0|9|1|1|An Angel Witnesses To Joseph
CJ|0|9|1|0|AND MARY told Joseph everything that happened to her while she was still working on the purple, and then ended her story with this assurance,
CJ|0|9|2|0|'Therefore I again assure you, father, that as truly as God, the Lord of heaven and earth lives, that truly am I also clean and know no man and know just as little about the secret of God which I now must carry under my heart to my own great anguish!'
CJ|0|9|3|0|Here Joseph became silent before Mary and was filled with a mighty dread - for Mary's words went deep into his distressed soul, and he quakingly found his secret presentiment confirmed.
CJ|0|9|4|0|He therefore began to consider back and forth what he should do and said in his heart,
CJ|0|9|5|0|'If I conceal from the world what it now considers to be an undeniable sin on Mary's part, even though I do not recognize it as such any more, I shall be adjudged a blasphemer against the Lord's law and will not escape certain punishment.
CJ|0|9|6|0|But if, against my innermost conviction, I reveal her as a cheap sinner before the sons of Israel, when That which she carries under her heart - according to her unequivocal statement - proceeds from an angel,
CJ|0|9|7|0|then I shall be found by the Lord God to be one who has delivered innocent blood to the judgment of death.
CJ|0|9|8|0|What then shall I do with her? Shall I secretly leave her, that is, shall I secretly send her away and hide her somewhere in the hills near the border of the Greeks?(4601)
CJ|0|9|9|0|Or shall I wait for the day of the Lord so He may then tell me what to do? And if tomorrow or the day after someone comes to me from Jerusalem and recognizes Mary, what then? Yes, I think it is best that I secretly send her away without anyone except my children knowing anything about it.
CJ|0|9|10|0|The Lord will surely reveal her innocence in time, and then everything will be saved and won; so let it be in the name of the Lord!'
CJ|0|9|11|0|Thereupon Joseph secretly made this known to Mary who acquiesced in Joseph's good intention, prepared herself and then, as it was already late in the evening, retired.
CJ|0|9|12|0|Joseph, given to his manifold thoughts, also fell into a slumber, when lo, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said to him:
CJ|0|9|13|0|'Joseph, have no fear about Mary, the purest maiden of the Lord! For What she carries under her heart is conceived by the Holy Spirit of God, and you shall give the Child, when He is born, the name: Jesus!'
CJ|0|9|14|0|Here Joseph awoke and praised the Lord God, who had bestowed such grace upon him.
CJ|0|9|15|0|And since it was already morning, Mary came to Joseph all ready for the intended journey, and indicated that it might be time to go.
CJ|0|9|16|0|At this Joseph embraced the girl, pressed her to his bosom and said to her: 'Mary, you pure one, you shall remain with me. Today the Lord has given me a mighty witness for you, for That which will be born from you shall be named: Jesus!
CJ|0|9|17|0|Here Mary knew immediately that the Lord had spoken to Joseph, since she now heard the same name which the angel had told her, although she had mentioned nothing of this before to Joseph. -
CJ|0|9|18|0|Joseph now watched over the girl attentively and let her want for nothing that she needed in that condition.
CJ|0|10|1|1|An Informer Hastens Back To Jerusalem
CJ|0|10|1|0|TWO WEEKS after this occurrence a great council was held in Jerusalem, because it had been ascertained from a few Romans residing there that the emperor would have the whole Jewish nation counted and recorded.
CJ|0|10|2|0|These tidings caused great consternation among the Jews, to whom it was forbidden to count people.
CJ|0|10|3|0|For that reason the high priest summoned a great assembly which all the elders and craftsmen, of whom Joseph was one, were to attend.
CJ|0|10|4|0|Now Joseph had just undertaken a little trip into the hills to gather wood for building and stayed away for several days.
CJ|0|10|5|0|And the messenger from Jerusalem, who came during that time to bring Joseph the call to the great council, gave the summons to his oldest son with the admonition to most urgently inform Joseph upon his return.
CJ|0|10|6|0|When Joseph already came home the following morning, his son Joses immediately informed him   of the  tidings  from Jerusalem.
CJ|0|10|7|0|At this Joseph said, 'For five days now I have been climbing around in the hills and have become very tired, any my feet would never carry me if I first did not rest for a couple of days - hence I am not compelled to follow the call from Jerusalem this time.
CJ|0|10|8|0|Besides, this whole assembly is not worth a straw, for the mighty emperor of Rome, who already swings his scepter over the lands of the Scythians, will take little notice of our consultation and will do as he pleases. So I shall stay right at home.'
CJ|0|10|9|0|Three days later Joseph was visited by a certain prominent scribe from Jerusalem named Annas, who asked him,
CJ|0|10|10|0|'Joseph, you who are a man from the tribe of David learned in the crafts and scriptures. I must ask you why you did not come to the assembly?'
CJ|0|10|11|0|Here Joseph turned to Annas and replied, 'See, I was in the hills for five days and did not know that I was called.
CJ|0|10|12|0|When I did get home and received the message through my son Joses, 1 was too weak and tired to make my way up to Jerusalem. And besides, I could see at the first glance that this whole great assembly would be of little if any use.'
CJ|0|10|13|0|While Joseph was speaking, Annas looked about and unluckily discovered the highly pregnant maiden.
CJ|0|10|14|0|He accordingly left Joseph as if speechless and hurried to Jerusalem as fast as he could.
CJ|0|10|15|0|Arrived there quite out of breath, he hastened at once to the high priest and said to him,
CJ|0|10|16|0|'Hear me, and do not ask me why the son of David did not come to the assembly, for I have discovered unheard-of abominations in his house.
CJ|0|10|17|0|See, Joseph, for whom God and you gave witness, in that you entrusted the maiden to him, has offended against God and you in an indescribably low and sensual way!'
CJ|0|10|18|0|The high priest, quite horrified at the tidings of Annas, asked brusquely, 'How is that, in what way? Speak the complete truth to me, or you shall pay with your life even today!'
CJ|0|10|19|0|Annas replied, 'See, the maiden Mary, whom according to the witness of God he received into his care from this temple of the Lord, he has thoroughly defiled - for her already high pregnancy is a living witness thereof!'
CJ|0|10|20|0|Here the high priest declared: 'No, Joseph has never done this. Can God also give a false witness?'
CJ|0|10|21|0|And Annas retorted, 'So then send your most trusted servants there, and you will be convinced that the maiden is in fact highly pregnant - and if she is not, then you can have me stoned here!
CJ|0|11|1|1|The Effect Of The Death Sentence
CJ|0|11|1|0|THE HIGH PRIEST considered for a while and said to himself, 'What shall I do? Annas is filled with envy at the choice for the maiden, and one should never follow the advice of the envious.
CJ|0|11|2|0|But if this should really be true with Mary, and I have been indifferent in the matter, what will the sons of Israel say then, and what sort of an accounting will they demand of me?
CJ|0|11|3|0|Therefore I will secretly send attendants to Joseph, and if the evil matter should be true, they shall compel the maiden as well as Joseph to come here without delay!'
CJ|0|11|4|0|Thus it was thought and decided; the high priest secretly called trusted attendants and told them what was said to have happened in Joseph's house, and sent them to Joseph with instructions what to do if this were confirmed.
CJ|0|11|5|0|Hereupon the attendants hastened to Joseph and found everything to be just as the highpriest had told them.
CJ|0|11|6|0|And the oldest of them said to Joseph, 'See, that is why we were sent here from the temple, to see for ourselves how matters stood with the maiden, since ill rumors about her have come to the ears of the high priest.
CJ|0|11|7|0|Now we have unfortunately found the sad suspicion confirmed, so do not make us use force and follow us into the temple with Mary, where you shall hear the just sentence from the mouth of the high priest.'
CJ|0|11|8|0|And Joseph promptly followed with Mary and was led by the attendants before the court in the temple.
CJ|0|11|9|0|When he arrived before the high priest, the astonished high priest thereupon asked Mary, speaking a serious tone,
CJ|0|11|10|0|'Mary! Why did you do this to us and how could you have so enormously degraded your soul?
CJ|0|11|11|0|You have forgotten the Lord, your God, you who were raised in the Holy of Holies and received your daily food from the hand of the angel
CJ|0|11|12|0|and always heard his songs of praise; and gladdened yourself and played and danced before the face of God! - Speak, why did you do this to us?'
CJ|0|11|13|0|Here Mary began to cry bitterly, and said between great sobs and tears, 'As truly as the Lord God of Israel lives, that truly also am I clean and have never known a man! Ask the of God chosen Joseph.'
CJ|0|11|14|0|The high priest thereupon turned to Joseph and asked him, 'Joseph, I adjure you in the name of the eternally living God, tell me openly, how did this happen? Have you done this?'
CJ|0|11|15|0|And Joseph asserted, 'I tell you by all that is holy to you and me, as truly as the Lord my God lives, that truly also am I clean before this maiden, as before you and before God!'
CJ|0|11|16|0|And the high priest retorted, 'Do not bear a false witness, but speak the truth before God! Now I say to you: you have taken your wedding into your own hands, you did not inform the temple and did not first bow your head under the hand of the eternally Almighty, so He might have blessed your seed! Therefore speak the truth!'
CJ|0|11|17|0|Joseph was mute at these words of the high priest and was unable to answer with even one word, for too bitterly unjust was the accusation of the high priest.
CJ|0|11|18|0|And since Joseph stood before the high priest in deep silence and could not speak, the high priest soon opened his mouth and demanded,
CJ|0|11|19|0|'Give us back the maiden as you received her from the temple of the Lord, when she was as pure as the rising sun on a  most  lovely  morning!'
CJ|0|11|20|0|Dissolving in tears Joseph stood there and after heaving a   great   sigh   exclaimed,
CJ|0|11|21|0|'Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, what evil have I, a poor old man, done before You that You now strike me so mightily?
CJ|0|11|22|0|Take me from the earth, for it is too hard as one always just before You and all the world to suffer such shame!
CJ|0|11|23|0|You chastised my father David because he sinned against Uriah.
CJ|0|11|24|0|But I have never sinned against any man nor harmed any man's property nor any creature, and have always followed the Law in everything - o Lord, why then do You strike me?
CJ|0|11|25|0|Oh show me a sin before You, and I will gladly suffer punishment by fire! But if I have sinned before You, then may the day and the hour be cursed when I was born!'
CJ|0|11|26|0|And the high priest became embittered at such speech of Joseph and decreed in great agitation of soul,
CJ|0|11|27|0|'Very well then, since you contest your obvious guilt before God, I will give you both to drink of the accursed water of the Lord God, and your sins shall become known in your eyes and before the eyes of all the people!'
CJ|0|11|28|0|Thereupon the high priest took the accursed water and gave Joseph to drink thereof and then sent him according to the law into the hills set aside for that purpose, close to Jerusalem.
CJ|0|11|29|0|Then he gave Mary to drink of this water and sent her into the hills also.
CJ|0|11|30|0|Three days later both returned unharmed, and all the people were surprised that no sin had been made manifest with them.
CJ|0|11|31|0|The high priest himself, amazed beyond measure, said to them, 'Since the Lord God has not desired to reveal your sin, then I too will not judge you, and instead declare you blameless and free!
CJ|0|11|32|0|But since the maiden is already pregnant, she shall become your wife as a penance because she became pregnant unbeknownst to me, and henceforth shall never again be given another husband, even though she should become a young widow. So be it! - Go your way in peace.'
CJ|0|11|33|0|Joseph now took Mary and went with her into his homeland and was full of joy, and honored and praised his God. And his joy was all the greater, since Mary had now become his rightful wife.
CJ|0|12|1|1|The Decree Of Augustus Caesar
CJ|0|12|1|0|JOSEPH in good spirits now spent two more months in his house with Mary, now his wife, and worked for her support.
CJ|0|12|2|0|When her time was fulfilled and Mary was close to the time of delivery, there came a new blow which caused Joseph great concern.
CJ|0|12|3|0|For the Roman emperor Augustus issued a decree in all his lands that all the peoples in his empire were to be counted, recorded and classified for reasons of taxation and recruitment.
CJ|0|12|4|0|The Nazarenes were not exempt from this command, and Joseph was compelled to go to Bethlehem, the city of David, where the Roman recording commission was set up.
CJ|0|12|5|0|When he heard this command, because of which he had already been called to an assembly in Jerusalem, he said to himself,
CJ|0|12|6|0|'My Lord and my God, this is a hard blow for me at this very time when Mary is so close to delivery!
CJ|0|12|7|0|What shall I do now? - I must of course have my sons recorded, for they are unfortunately subject to bearing arms for the emperor, but what in heaven's name, o Lord, shall I do with Mary?
CJ|0|12|8|0|I cannot leave her at home, for what would she do when her time began to press her?
CJ|0|12|9|0|But if I take her along, who will assure me that her time will not befall her while still on the way and I will not know what to do with her?
CJ|0|12|10|0|And if I do just manage to bring her before the officials of Rome, how shall I have her recorded there?
CJ|0|12|11|0|Perhaps as my wife - whereof no one except myself and the high priest knows anything?
CJ|0|12|12|0|Truly, I am almost ashamed to do that before the sons of Israel, for they know that I am an old man of over seventy years. What will they say, if I record the barely fifteen-year-old child - and that in a highly pregnant condition - as my lawful wife?
CJ|0|12|13|0|Or should I have her recorded as my daughter? But the sons of Israel know whence Mary is, and that she is not my daughter.
CJ|0|12|14|0|If I have her recorded as the to-me-entrusted maiden of the Lord, what might those few, who may not know that I have justified myself in the temple, say to me so they were to see Mary highly pregnant? -
CJ|0|12|15|0|Yes, now I know what I will do - I will wait for the day of the Lord! On that day the Lord my God will do what He thinks best and it will also be for the best! So be it.'
CJ|0|13|1|1|He Who Always Was Journeys To Bethlehem
CJ|0|13|1|0|THE SAME DAY a wise old friend from Nazareth came to Joseph and said to him,
CJ|0|13|2|0|'Brother, see, thus does the Lord lead His people through many deserts and steppes. And those who willingly follow where He leads will come to the right place.
CJ|0|13|3|0|We languished in Egypt and wept beneath Babylon's chains, but the Lord freed us!
CJ|0|13|4|0|Now the Romans have sent their eagles over us - it is the Lord's will! Therefore we will do what He wants, for He surely knows why He wants it that way.'
CJ|0|13|5|0|Joseph well understood what the friend meant to say to him, and when the friend had blessed him and departed, Joseph said to his sons,
CJ|0|13|6|0|'Listen to me! The Lord want? that we all go to Bethlehem, so let us bow to His will.
CJ|0|13|7|0|You, Joel, saddle the she-ass for Mary, and use the saddle with the back rest; and you, Joses, bridle the ox and harness him to the cart in which we will take our food.
CJ|0|13|8|0|You, Samuel, Simeon and James, provide the cart with stable fruits, bread, honey and cheese, and take enough to provide us for fourteen days, for we do not know when our turn will come, when we will be free to go, and what might happen with Mar)' on the way. So put fresh linen and baby napkins in the cart also.'
CJ|0|13|9|0|Here the sons provided for everything as told,
CJ|0|13|10|0|and when everything was ready they informed Joseph.
CJ|0|13|11|0|Joseph  then  knelt  down with his whole house, prayed and commended himself and all his family into the hands of the Lord.
CJ|0|13|12|0|When he had finished praying, praising and glorifying God, he heard a voice which seemed to come from outside the house, saying:
CJ|0|13|13|0|'Joseph, oh faithful son of David, who was a man after the heart of God!
CJ|0|13|14|0|When David went out to battle with the giant, there was with him the hand of the angel whom the Lord placed at his side, and behold, your father became a mighty victor!
CJ|0|13|15|0|But with you is He Himself who always was, who created heaven and earth, who in Noah's time let it rain forty days and nights and let drown all men contrary to Him,
CJ|0|13|16|0|who gave Isaac to Abraham, who led your people out of Egypt and terribly talked to Moses on Sinai!
CJ|0|13|17|0|Behold, He now is in your house bodily and will also journey with you to Bethlehem - so be without fear, for it will not be permitted that one hair on your head be harmed!'
CJ|0|13|18|0|When Joseph heard these words he was glad, thanked the Lord for this grace and promptly had all prepared themselves for the journey.
CJ|0|13|19|0|He took Mary and set her on the she-ass as softly and comfortably as he possibly could and then took the reins in his hand and led the pack animal.
CJ|0|13|20|0|The sons grouped themselves about the loaded cart and went with it after the pacing donkey.
CJ|0|13|21|0|After a while Joseph handed the reins to his oldest son, and he himself walked at Mary's side, since she sometimes became weak and was not able to hold herself in the saddle alone.
CJ|0|14|1|1|See, There In The Hill Is A Cave
CJ|0|14|1|0|THUS THE TRULY DEVOUT group of travelers came within six hours of Bethlehem and rested in the open.
CJ|0|14|2|0|Here Joseph looked toward Mary and saw that she must be full of pain, so he thought quite disconcertedly,
CJ|0|14|3|0|'What is the matter? Mary's countenance is filled of pain, and her eyes are filled with tears. Perhaps her time presses her?'
CJ|0|14|4|0|Therefore Joseph looked at Mary again more closely, and behold, this time he found to his great surprise that she was laughing.
CJ|0|14|5|0|At this he asked her, 'Mary, tell me, what is going on in your heart? For I first see your face filled with pain, and then laughing and radiating great joy!'
CJ|0|14|6|0|And Mary said to Joseph: 'See, I now have two nations before me! The one wept, so I wept with it out of sympathy.
CJ|0|14|7|0|But the other walked before me laughing, and I was filled with joy and happiness, and had to laugh along with it and take part in its joy.3 - That is all that drew pain and joy from my face.'
CJ|0|14|8|0|When Joseph heard this he was reassured, for he knew that Mary oftentimes had visions; accordingly he had the journey resumed and went up toward Bethlehem.
CJ|0|14|9|0|When they came close to Bethlehem, Mary suddenly announced to Joseph,
CJ|0|14|10|0|'Listen to me, Joseph! That which is within me begins to press me with great force, so call a halt!'
CJ|0|14|11|0|Joseph was thoroughly alarmed at Mary's sudden announcement, for he now realized that her time had come.
CJ|0|14|12|0|He therefore called a sudden halt, whereupon Mary hastily said to Joseph,
CJ|0|14|13|0|'Lift me down from the donkey, for That which is in me presses me mightily and wants to leave me - and I cannot resist Its force any longer!'
CJ|0|14|14|0|At this Joseph declared, 'But in heaven's name! You can see that an inn is nowhere in sight - where then shall I put you?'
CJ|0|14|15|0|And Mary said, 'See, there in the hill is a cave - it can hardly be a hundred steps to there. Bring me there - it is impossible for me to go on!'
CJ|0|14|16|0|Thereupon Joseph led his party of travelers to there and with great good luck found some hay and straw in this cave, since it served the shepherds as a stable in time of need, and immediately had a makeshift bed prepared for Mary.
CJ|0|15|1|1|And Nature Stood Still
CJ|0|15|1|0|WHEN THE RESTING PLACE was prepared, Joseph brought Mary into the cave, where she lay down on the bed of hay and straw and found some relief in this position.
CJ|0|15|2|0|When Mary was thus provided for, Joseph said to his sons,
CJ|0|15|3|0|'You two oldest keep watch over Mary and give her the proper care if she needs it, especially you, Joel, since you learned something about this matter from my friends in Nazareth.'
CJ|0|15|4|0|Then he told the other three to look after the donkey and the ox and to find a place for the cart inside the fairly spacious cave.
CJ|0|15|5|0|When Joseph had looked to all these things he said to Mary, 'Now I will go up on the hill and hurriedly seek a midwife in the city of my father and will bring her here to give you aid.'
CJ|0|15|6|0|After these words Joseph went out of the cave. It was already late in the evening and the stars were well discernible in the sky.
CJ|0|15|7|0|Here, in Joseph's own words, are his remarkable experiences after leaving the cave, as he told his sons upon his return with the midwife when Mary had already given birth.
CJ|0|15|8|0|And Joseph's words were as follows: 'Children, we are on the threshold of great things! Now I begin to understand what the voice told me on the evening before our departure. Truly, if the Lord were not present with us - even though unseen - such wondrous things as I now have seen could not possibly take place!
CJ|0|15|9|0|'Listen! - After I left the cave and went on my way, it seemed to me as if I were not walking! And I saw the rising full moon and the stars in the east as well as in the west, and lo, everything stood still, and the moon did not leave the earth's horizon, and the stars on the western horizon would not set!
CJ|0|15|10|0|'Then I saw flocks upon flocks of birds sitting on the limbs of the trees - all had their faces turned hereward and trembled as in times of great, imminent earthquakes, and could not have been dislodged from their places with shouts or stones.
CJ|0|15|11|0|'And I looked around on the ground again and saw a group of workmen not far from me who sat around a bowl filled with food - some held their hands motionless in the bowl and were unable to lift food out of it.
CJ|0|15|12|0|'Those who had already lifted a morsel from the bowl held it at the mouth which they could not open, so they might eat; and all faces were turned upward as if they saw great things in the sky.
CJ|0|15|13|0|'Then I saw sheep which were being driven by the shepherds; but the sheep stood motionless, and the hand of the shepherd who lifted it to strike the tarrying sheep remained in the air as if paralyzed and he could not move it.
CJ|0|15|14|0|'Again I saw a whole herd of rams who held their muzzles over the water but were unable to drink, for they all were as if completely paralyzed.
CJ|0|15|15|0|'And I also saw a brook which had a long waterfall coming down from the hill, and behold, the water stood still and did not fall down into the valley! - Thus all things on the ground appeared as if they had neither life nor motion.
CJ|0|15|16|0|'As I stood there or walked and did not know whether I was standing or walking, lo, I finally saw life again.
CJ|0|15|17|0|For a woman came down the side of the hill directly toward me and when she reached me, asked; Man, where are you going so late?
CJ|0|15|18|0|And I said: I seek a midwife; for there in the cave is one who would give birth!
CJ|0|15|19|0|The woman then asked: Is she of Israel? I replied: Yes, lady, I and she are of Israel. David is our father!
CJ|0|15|20|0|The woman asked further: Who is she that would give birth there in the cave? Is she your wife, or a relative, or a maidservant?
CJ|0|15|21|0|I then answered: Since a short time my wife only before God and the high priest; but when she became pregnant she was not yet my wife and was only entrusted into my care from the temple by the witness of God, since she had formerly been brought up in the Holy of Holies!
CJ|0|15|22|0|But do not be surprised at her pregnancy - for That which is in her is wonderfully conceived by the Holy Spirit of God! At this the woman was amazed and demanded of me: Man, tell me the truth! - And I said: Come and see, and convince yourself with your own eyes!'
CJ|0|16|1|1|The Vision Of The Midwife
CJ|0|16|1|0|THE WOMAN consented and followed Joseph to the cave, and when they arrived there, the cave suddenly became enveloped in a thick white cloud, so that they were unable to find the entrance.
CJ|0|16|2|0|At this phenomenon the midwife expressed great surprise and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|16|3|0|'My soul has this day experienced great things! This morning I had a sublime, wondrous vision, in which everything turned out as I now have seen it in reality, still see it and shall see more!
CJ|0|16|4|0|You are the same man who came toward me in the vision. I also saw all the world rest in the midst of its appointed rounds and saw how a cloud came over the cave, and spoke with you as I now have spoken.
CJ|0|16|5|0|And I saw still more most wondrous things in the cave, when my sister Salome came after me, to whom alone I confided my vision in the morning!
CJ|0|16|6|0|Therefore I now say before you and before the Lord, my God: A great salvation is come to Israel! A Savior came, sent from above, in the time of our great distress!'
CJ|0|16|7|0|After these words of the midwife the cloud quickly withdrew from the cave, and a light of such intensity streamed from the cave toward the midwife and Joseph that their eyes were not able to bear it, and the midwife exclaimed, 'Everything is then true that I have seen in the vision! Oh man, you fortunate one, here is more than Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and Elias!'
CJ|0|16|8|0|Thereupon the strong light gradually became more and more bearable, and the Baby became visible, just as He took His mother's breast for the first time.
CJ|0|16|9|0|The midwife now went into the cave with Joseph, inspected the Baby and His mother, and when she found everything loosed to perfection she asserted:
CJ|0|16|10|0|'Truly, truly, That is the Savior extolled by all the prophets, who will be free of bonds already in His mother's body, to signify that He will unbind all the hard bonds of the Law!
CJ|0|16|11|0|Now when has anyone seen that a newly-born child already reached for its mother's breast?
CJ|0|16|12|0|That truly is visible proof that this Child when a man will one day judge the world according to love, and not according to the Law!
CJ|0|16|13|0|Hear, you most fortunate husband of this maiden! Everything is in the best possible order, therefore let me go out of the cave, for it now begins to weigh heavily upon my breast, since I feel that I am not clean enough to bear the holy nearness of my and your Lord and God!'
CJ|0|16|14|0|Joseph was thoroughly shocked at these words of the midwife, and she hastened out of the cave into the open.
CJ|0|16|15|0|As she went out of the cave she met her sister Salome outside, who had followed her because she knew of the vision, and immediately said to her,
CJ|0|16|16|0|'Salome, Salome, come and see my vision of the morning confirmed in reality! The virgin has given birth in fullness of truth to that which human wisdom and nature can never comprehend!'
CJ|0|16|17|0|And Salome replied, 'As truly as God lives am I unable to believe that a virgin is supposed to have given birth until I have examined her with my hand!'
CJ|0|17|1|1|The Doubting Salome Is Forgiven
CJ|0|17|1|0|AFTER SALOME SAID THIS, she went into the cave and said,
CJ|0|17|2|0|'Mary, my soul is in no little conflict; therefore I would ask you that you prepare yourself, so I may examine you with my well-experienced hand and learn therefrom how matters stand with your virginity!'
CJ|0|17|3|0|Mary willingly acquiesced in the desire of the unbelieving Salome, prepared herself, and allowed herself to be examined.
CJ|0|17|4|0|But as soon as Salome touched Mary's body with her experienced hand, she began a mighty lament and cried out at the top of her voice,
CJ|0|17|5|0|'Woe, woe to me because of my ungodliness and my great disbelief, that I wanted to tempt the eternally living God! See, see here - my hand is being consumed in the fire of the divine wrath over wretched me!'
CJ|0|17|6|0|After these words she quickly fell down on her knees before the Baby and exclaimed,
CJ|0|17|7|0|'O God of my fathers! You almighty Lord of all glory! Remember me, that I am also a seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!
CJ|0|17|8|0|Oh do not set me up to ridicule before the sons of Israel, but give me back my healthy limbs again!'
CJ|0|17|9|0|And behold, thereupon an angel of the Lord stood beside Salome and said to her, 'The Lord God has granted your entreaty - go over to the little Child and carry Him, and a great salvation will be yours for it!'
CJ|0|17|10|0|When Salome heard this, she went on her knees over to Mary and asked her for the Baby.
CJ|0|17|11|0|Mary willingly gave her the Baby and said to her, 'May He be to your salvation according to the saying of the angel of the Lord; may the Lord have mercy on you!'
CJ|0|17|12|0|And Salome took the Baby on her arms and while thus carrying Him kneeling testified:
CJ|0|17|13|0|'O God, You almighty Lord of Israel, You who reign and govern from eternity! In all, all fullness of truth is here born to Israel a King of Kings who will be mightier than there was David, the man after the heart of God. You I shall honor and praise forever!'
CJ|0|17|14|0|After these words Salome was completely healed again, then gave the Baby back to Mary in the most grateful contrition of her heart and thus justified went out of the cave.
CJ|0|17|15|0|And when she was outside, she wanted to cry out aloud about the great wonder of all wonders and had already begun to tell her sister what had happened to her.
CJ|0|17|16|0|At this a voice was heard from above, and it said, 'Salome, Salome, be sure to tell no one, what extraordinary thing has happened to you! For the time is still to come when the Lord will testify of Himself in words and deeds!'
CJ|0|17|17|0|At this Salome became silent, and Joseph went out and asked the two sisters to return to the cave according to Mary's wish, so no one should notice anything of the wonderful things that had taken place in this cave this day. And both humbly went back into the cave.
CJ|0|18|1|1|Peace On Earth, Good Will To Men
CJ|0|18|1|0|WHEN ALL WERE gathered together in the cave, the sons of Joseph  asked  their  father,
CJ|0|18|2|0|'Father, what shall we do now? Everything has been well attended to! The trip has tired our bodies, may we not retire?'
CJ|0|18|3|0|Joseph replied, 'Children, you have witnessed the infinite grace which has befallen us all from above - so you should stay up and glorify God with me!
CJ|0|18|4|0|And you have witnessed what happened to Salome in the cave because she would not believe - so we should not be sleepy either when the Lord visits us!
CJ|0|18|5|0|Now go over to Mary and touch the Baby! Who knows, whether your eyelids will not quickly be so refreshed as if you had slept solidly for several hours!'
CJ|0|18|6|0|The sons of Joseph now went over and touched the Baby, and the Baby smiled at them and stretched His hands toward them, as if He recognized them as brothers.
CJ|0|18|7|0|At this all were surprised and said, 'Truly, that is no ordinary Child! For where has it happened to anyone, that he was greeted so heartily by a newly-born child?
CJ|0|18|8|0|Besides, we now have all been so completely restored in all our limbs as if we had never made a journey and were at home on a morning with a fully rested body!'
CJ|0|18|9|0|Joseph said, 'See, so my advice was good! But now I feel that it is becoming quite cool, so bring the donkey and the ox here. The animals will lie close to us and will give off some warmth by their breath and their body heat, and we will place ourselves close to Mary also.'
CJ|0|18|10|0|This the sons did. And when they brought the two animals close to Mary, these immediately lay down at the head end of Mary's resting place, breathed diligently over Mary and the Baby and thus warmed Him quite well.
CJ|0|18|11|0|And the midwife said, 'Truly, that cause can be of no little importance before God, which even the animals serve as if they had reason and understanding.'
CJ|0|18|12|0|Here Salome added: 'Oh sister, the animals seem to see more here than we do! While we hardly dare to think, the animals already worship Him who has created them!
CJ|0|18|13|0|Believe me, sister, as truly as God lives, that truly also is the promised Messiah here before us - for we know that such wonderful things have never taken place even at the birth of the greatest prophet!'
CJ|0|18|14|0|And Mary said to Salome, 'The Lord God has shown you great grace in that you behold That before which my soul quakes itself.
CJ|0|18|15|0|But be silent about it, as the angel of the Lord bid you to do previously, or you could prepare a bitter lot for us!'
CJ|0|18|16|0|At this Salome vowed to Mary that she would remain silent the rest of her life, and the midwife followed her sister's example.
CJ|0|18|17|0|Everything now became still in the cave. And in the First hour before sunrise all heard ever-so-mighty songs of praise outside the cave.
CJ|0|18|18|0|Joseph at once sent his oldest son to investigate what it was, and who was singing so mightily to God's glory out in the open.
CJ|0|18|19|0|And Joel went outside and saw that all the reaches of the Firmament were Filled - high and low - with countless myriads of shining angels. And he hastened back into the cave in astonishment and told them all what he had seen.
CJ|0|18|20|0|All were highly astonished at Joel's report and went outside and convinced themselves of the truth of Joel's assertion.
CJ|0|18|21|0|When they had seen such glory of the Lord, they went back into the cave and bore witness to Mary. And Joseph said to Mary:
CJ|0|18|22|0|'Hear, oh purest maiden of the Lord, the fruit of your body is truly conceived by the Holy Spirit of God - for all the heavens  now bear witness thereto!
CJ|0|18|23|0|But what will happen to us, when all the world is now sure to Find out what took place here? For I have just seen by the many shepherds that not only we, but all other people now see what manner of witness shines for us through all the heavens, for the shepherds had their faces turned upward
CJ|0|18|24|0|and sang in harmony with the mighty choirs of angels which now visibly fill all the reaches of the heavens high and low down to the earth.
CJ|0|18|25|0|And their song sounded like that of the angels: Descend with your grace, o ye heavens, upon the just! Peace on earth to all men of good will! And glory to God on high in Him who comes in the name of the Lord!
CJ|0|18|26|0|See, Mary, the whole world now hears and sees this, therefore it will also come here and will persecute us, and we will have to flee over hill and dale!
CJ|0|18|27|0|And so I believe that we should depart from here as soon as we possibly can, and as soon as I shall be recorded - which shall take place still early today - we shall go back to Nazareth and from there over to the Greeks of whom I know several very well. Do you not agree with me?'
CJ|0|18|28|0|Here Mary said to Joseph, 'But you can see that I cannot leave this resting place today, so let us leave everything to the Lord. He has led and protected us up to now, so He surely will continue to lead us and protect us ever so faithfully!
CJ|0|18|29|0|If He wants to reveal us before the world, say: to where would we flee where He could not find us?
CJ|0|18|30|0|Therefore His will be done! What He wants, that will be right. See, here on my bosom rests He whom all this concerns!
CJ|0|18|31|0|He will surely remain with us, and thus God's great glory will not depart from us either, though we flee wherever we will!'
CJ|0|18|32|0|Mary had hardly finished speaking, when behold, two angels stood before the cave as leaders of a large group of shepherds and made it known to the shepherds that here was born the One who was the object of their songs of praise.
CJ|0|18|33|0|And the shepherds went into the cave, knelt down before the Baby and worshiped Him; and the angels also came in bands and worshiped the Baby.
CJ|0|18|34|0|Here Joseph with his sons looked over toward Mary and the Baby in great astonishment and asked, 'O God, what does this mean? Have You Yourself assumed flesh in this Child?
CJ|0|18|35|0|For how could it otherwise be possible that He would be worshiped even by Your holy angels? But if You are here, o Lord, how then do matters stand with the temple and the Holy of Holies?'
CJ|0|18|36|0|Thereupon an angel went over to Joseph and said to him: 'Do not ask, and have no concern - for the Lord has chosen the earth to be the stage of His mercies and has now visited His people, as He has foretold through the mouths of His children, His servants and prophets!
CJ|0|18|37|0|What now happens before your eyes takes place according to the will of Him who is holy, most holy.'
CJ|0|18|38|0|The angel then left Joseph and again went over and worshiped the Baby, who now smiled on all the worshipers with open hands.
CJ|0|18|39|0|When the sun rose, the angels disappeared, but the shepherds remained and inquired of Joseph how this had come to be.
CJ|0|18|40|0|And Joseph answered, 'Hear, as wondrously as the grass grows out of the earth, so also did this wonder happen! Now who knows how the grass grows? Just as little also am I able to tell you about this wonder. God wanted it this way - that is all I can tell you!'
CJ|0|19|1|1|Cornelius Visits The Cave
CJ|0|19|1|0|THE SHEPHERDS were satisfied with this answer and did not inquire of Joseph any more but left and brought Mary assorted refreshments as an offering.
CJ|0|19|2|0|When the sun had already been shining for an hour, Joseph asked the midwife,
CJ|0|19|3|0|'Listen to me, my lady friend and sister from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! See, the recording causes me much distress of heart, and I desire nothing more eagerly than to have it over with.
CJ|0|19|4|0|But I do not know where it is being held in the town. So leave Salome here with Mary, and lead me with my sons to the Roman captain who is in charge of the recording.
CJ|0|19|5|0|Perhaps we will be received at once, since we will surely be the first ones there.'
CJ|0|19|6|0|Here the midwife said to Joseph, 'Man full of grace, listen to me! The captain Cornelius from Rome lives in my house, which is one of the first ones into the town,
CJ|0|19|7|0|and has his room for his official duties there. He is, to be sure, a pagan, but otherwise a good and law-abiding man. I will go there and make everything known to him with the exception of the wonder, and I believe that will take care of the matter.'
CJ|0|19|8|0|This offer well pleased Joseph, since he was very shy of the Romans anyhow and especially of the recording, so he again asked the midwife to do this for him.
CJ|0|19|9|0|The midwife now left and found that Cornelius, who was quite young and liked to sleep late in the morning, was still in bed and told him all he needed to know.
CJ|0|19|10|0|Cornelius arose at once, threw his toga about him and said to his landlady, 'Woman, I believe you in everything, but I will nevertheless go there with you, for I feel a strong urge to do so!
CJ|0|19|11|0|By your account it is not far from here, so I will still be at my work-table in time. - So lead me there right away!'
CJ|0|19|12|0|The midwife was quite pleased at this and led the upright young captain, with whom she was well acquainted, to the cave. Arrived there, he admitted to her, 'Oh woman, how easily when in Rome do I go to my emperor, and how difficult it is for me here to go into this cave!
CJ|0|19|13|0|That must be something extraordinary! Now tell me whether you know any reason for that, for I know you are an upright Jewess.'
CJ|0|19|14|0|The midwife answered, 'Good captain of the great emperor! Wait here in front of the cave only a moment and I will go in and bring you the answer.'
CJ|0|19|15|0|And she went in and told Joseph that the good captain himself was waiting outside the cave and that he wanted to enter but could not bring himself to do so for an inexplicable reason.
CJ|0|19|16|0|When Joseph heard this he was moved and said, 'O God, how good You are, that You can change even that into joy before me of which I had the most fear. Therefore to You alone be all honor and all praise!'
CJ|0|19|17|0|After these words he hastened out of the cave and fell at the feet of Cornelius, saying, 'Bearer of the great emperor's power, have mercy on me, a poor old man! See, my young wife, who was given into my care by lot in the temple, has here unburdened herself of her fruit this night, and I arrived here only yesterday, so I was not able to promptly report to you.'
CJ|0|19|18|0|And Cornelius replied, while lifting up Joseph, 'Oh man, do not worry about that, for everything is in order. But let me come in and see how you are put up here.'
CJ|0|19|19|0|Joseph then led Cornelius into the cave. And when the latter saw the Baby and how He smiled at him, he was astonished at His behavior and affirmed, 'By Zeus, that is rare! Why, I feel as if I were a new person, and never have I experienced such peace and joy within me! - In fact, today I shall take a holiday from official duties and remain your guest.'
CJ|0|20|1|1|Cornelius Sees A Great Light
CJ|0|20|1|0|JOSEPH WAS greatly pleased at this and asked the captain, 'Bearer of the great emperor's power, what can a poor man like me possibly offer you in return for your great friendship? With what will I be able to serve you in this damp cave?
CJ|0|20|2|0|How can I set the table for you in keeping with your high station? - See, here in the cart are all my worldly goods, in part brought along from Nazareth, and in part a gift from the shepherds in this locality.
CJ|0|20|3|0|If you can partake of some of it, then may every bite you eat be blessed a thousandfold!'
CJ|0|20|4|0|Cornelius replied, 'Good man, do not be concerned about me in the least. For here as you see is my landlady on whom we can depend to look after the kitchen, and we will have all we need for a little coin decorated with the emperor's head.'
CJ|0|20|5|0|Here the captain gave the midwife a gold coin and left the preparation of a good noon and evening meal to her, as well as the procurement of better living quarters as soon as it would be possible for the young mother to leave.
CJ|0|20|6|0|Joseph thereupon said to Cornelius, 'Oh wonderful friend, please do not go to any expense and trouble for us, for we are anyhow - all praise to the Lord, the God of Israel! - well supplied for the few days we shall yet be here.'
CJ|0|20|7|0|At this the captain said, 'Good is good, but better is better. So just let it be and allow me thereby to bring a joyous offering to your God also. You see, I honor the gods of all peoples.
CJ|0|20|8|0|Thus I also want to honor your God, for He pleases me, since I have seen His temple at Jerusalem. And He must be a God of great wisdom, since you have learned such great artifice from Him.'
CJ|0|20|9|0|Joseph responded, 'Oh friend, if it were possible for me to convince you of the sole and absolute Being of our God, how gladly I would do so to your greatest eternal welfare!
CJ|0|20|10|0|But I am only a frail man and am not capable of doing that. But if you will seek out any of our books and read them, since you are so well versed in our language, you will find things there which will cause you the greatest astonishment!'
CJ|0|20|11|0|And Cornelius replied, 'Good man, what you now have advised me to do, that I have already done and have also found truly astonishing things!
CJ|0|20|12|0|Among other things I also came upon a prediction in which a new King is promised to the Jews forever. Tell me whether you know, according to the interpretation of this prediction, when this King will come and from where.'
CJ|0|20|13|0|At this Joseph was a bit embarrassed and said after a pause: 'The Latter will come from the heavens as the Son of the eternally living God! And His kingdom will not be of this, but of the world of the spirit and the truth!'
CJ|0|20|14|0|Cornelius said, 'Good, I understand you. But I have also read that this King is to be born in a stable near this town of a maiden. How is that to be taken?'
CJ|0|20|15|0|Joseph answered, 'Good man, you have sharp senses! I can tell you nothing else than: Go over and look at the little maiden with the new-born Child - there you will find what you are able to find!'
CJ|0|20|16|0|And Cornelius went over and with sharp eyes looked at the maiden with the Baby, so he might discover from her and the Child the future King of the Jews.
CJ|0|20|17|0|Accordingly he asked Mary, in what manner she had become pregnant so early.
CJ|0|20|18|0|Mary replied, 'Just man! As truly as my God lives, that truly also have I never known a man!
CJ|0|20|19|0|But three-quarters of the year ago it happened that a messenger of the Lord came to me and informed me in a few words that I would become pregnant by the Spirit of God.
CJ|0|20|20|0|And so it was, for I became pregnant without ever having known a man, and see, here before you is the fruit of the marvelous promise! And God is my witness that it all happened in this manner!'
CJ|0|20|21|0|At this Cornelius turned to the two sisters and inquired, 'What do you say to this story? Is it a clever deceit by this old man, a good pretense for a blind, superstitious people in order to avoid lawful punishment under such circumstances?
CJ|0|20|22|0|For I know that the Jews have decreed punishment by death in such cases! Or should there actually be something to it - which would be worse than in the first case, for then the law of the emperor would have to be invoked in the most drastic way, since it wants every usurper to be nipped in the bud? Now speak the truth, so I may know how I stand with this singular family!'
CJ|0|20|23|0|And Salome asserted, 'Listen to me, Cornelius, I beg you by your full imperial authority! Be sure that you do not undertake any serious and legal steps against this poor and then again infinitely wealthy family!
CJ|0|20|24|0|For you can believe me, and I will forfeit my head for the truth of it: all the powers of the heavens are at this family's disposal, like your own arm is to you, of which I received a most convincing witness!'
CJ|0|20|25|0|At this Cornelius was still more deeply startled and asked Salome, 'Then also Rome's holy gods, Rome's heroes, weapons and invincible power? - Oh Salome, how can you speak like that?'
CJ|0|20|26|0|Here Salome answered, 'Yes, as you have said, so it is! Of that I am convinced through and through. But if you are unable to believe it, then go outside and look at the sun! It is already shining almost four hours today, and behold, it still stands in the east and dares not travel any farther on its way!'
CJ|0|20|27|0|And Cornelius went outside, looked at the sun, promptly returned and said in great astonishment, 'In truth, you are right. If the matter has reference to this family, why then even the god Apollo obeys this family!
CJ|0|20|28|0|Hence Zeus, the mightiest of all the gods must be here, and it seems that the time of Deucalion and Pyrrha is again coming to pass. And if that is the case, then I certainly must report such an occurrence to Rome without delay!'
CJ|0|20|29|0|At these words two mighty angels appeared. Their faces shone like the sun and their garments like lightning. And they said: 'Cornelius, be silent even against yourself about What you have seen - or you and Rome will perish yet today!'
CJ|0|20|30|0|At this a great fear came over Cornelius. The two angels disappeared, and he went over to Joseph and declared: 'Oh man, here is infinitely more than a future King of the Jews! Here is He at whose command stand all the heavens and hells! Therefore let me go my way again from here, for I am not worthy to be present in such nearness of God!'
CJ|0|21|1|1|Joseph Tells How God Respects Free Will
CJ|0|21|1|0|JOSEPH WAS also quite taken aback at this utterance of Cornelius and admitted to him, 'How great this wonder is, I do not know myself,
CJ|0|21|2|0|but you can believe me that great and mighty things are behind it, for on behalf of small matters all the powers of the eternal heavens of God would not thus assert themselves!
CJ|0|21|3|0|But for all that no man is hindered in his free will and can do as he pleases. That I can see from the command which the two angels of the Lord gave you.
CJ|0|21|4|0|See, the Lord could bind our free will in this instance, as He binds the will of the animals, and we would have to act according to His will!
CJ|0|21|5|0|But that He does not do, and instead He gives only a free commandment, from which we can learn His holy will.
CJ|0|21|6|0|Therefore you are not in the least bound in any fiber of your being and can do as you please! If you want to be my guest today, then stay, but if you would rather not or do not dare to do so, then you have your altogether free will there also.
CJ|0|21|7|0|But if I were to advise you, I would say: Oh friend, stay, for you surely could not be in better hands anywhere in the whole world than here under the visible protection of all the powers of heaven.'
CJ|0|21|8|0|Cornelius answered, 'Yes, you just man before the gods and before your God and before all men, your advice is good, and I shall heed it and will remain with you until tomorrow.
CJ|0|21|9|0|I shall be gone with my landlady for only a short time, so I can make arrangements that all of you - although here in this cave - shall have better lodging.'
CJ|0|21|10|0|Here Joseph said, 'Good man, do as you please. The Lord God will someday reward you!'
CJ|0|21|11|0|Hereupon the captain went into the town with the midwife and first had it announced in all the lanes that this day was a holiday from official duties, then took thirty warriors, gave them bedding, tents and firewood and told them to carry all this out to the cave.
CJ|0|21|12|0|The midwife took food and drink with her in sufficient quantity and had still more brought after her.
CJ|0|21|13|0|Once back in the cave, the captain promptly had three tents set up: a soft-textured one for Mary, one for himself, Joseph and his sons and one for the midwife and her sister.
CJ|0|21|14|0|In Mary's tent he had a fresh and very soft bed set up and also provided the tent with other necessary accommodations. Thus he also provided for the needs of the other tents, then had his soldiers build a cooking hearth in all haste, placed wood on it himself and made a fire to warm the cave, in which it normally was quite cold at this time of the year.
CJ|0|22|1|1|The Rising Of The New Spiritual Sun
CJ|0|22|1|0|THUS CORNELIUS PROVIDED for the devout family and remained with them all that day and the following night.
CJ|0|22|2|0|That afternoon the shepherds also returned to worship the Baby, and brought various offerings.
CJ|0|22|3|0|But when they saw tents and the Roman captain in the cave, they wanted to flee in great fear of him,
CJ|0|22|4|0|for there were several fugitives from the Roman recording among them, who were in great fear of the punishment decreed for such fugitives.
CJ|0|22|5|0|Here the captain went over to them and said, 'Do not be afraid of me, for I now release you from all punishment, but consider what must be done according to the will of the emperor, so come tomorrow, and I shall record you as gently and kindly as I possibly can!'
CJ|0|22|6|0|When the shepherds learned that Cornelius was such a gentle man, they lost their timidity and they all came the following day to be recorded.
CJ|0|22|7|0|After the talk with the shepherds, the captain asked Joseph whether the sun this time would never leave the morning.
CJ|0|22|8|0|Joseph answered, 'This sun, which rose for the earth today, never! But the natural sun goes its usual way according to the will of the Lord and will set in a few short hours!'
CJ|0|22|9|0|Joseph spoke this prophetically and hardly knew or understood himself what he had spoken.
CJ|0|22|10|0|Here the captain asked Joseph, 'What do you mean? See, I did not grasp the meaning of your words, so speak more plainly to me!'
CJ|0|22|11|0|And Joseph affirmed: 'The time will come when you will warm yourself in the holy rays of this sun and bathe in the streams of its Spirit!
CJ|0|22|12|0|I do not know what more to tell you and do not understand myself, what I have just told you; but in time, when I am no more, it will be revealed to you in all fullness of eternal truth!'
CJ|0|22|13|0|And the captain asked Joseph no more and kept these profound words in his heart.
CJ|0|22|14|0|The following day the captain greeted the whole family and gave them the assurance that he would provide for them as long as they remained there, and would keep them in his heart for the rest of his life.
CJ|0|22|15|0|After that he returned to his duties and gave the midwife another coin to care for the family.
CJ|0|22|16|0|When the captain had departed, Joseph said to his sons, 'Children, how is it that a pagan is better than many a Jew? Do you suppose that the words of Isaiah apply here, where he says:
CJ|0|22|17|0|Behold, my servants shall shout with joy of spirit, but you shall cry out in anguish and weep from misery. - And the sons of Joseph replied, 'Yes, father, this passage wholly applies here and is to be understood.'
CJ|0|23|1|1|Joseph And Mary Go To Jerusalem
CJ|0|23|1|0|THUS JOSEPH SPENT six days in the cave and was visited by Cornelius every day, who saw to it most diligently that this family should lack for nothing.
CJ|0|23|2|0|And on the sixth day early in the morning an angel came to Joseph and said, 'Obtain a pair of turtledoves, and go from here to Jerusalem on the eighth day!
CJ|0|23|3|0|Mary shall offer up the turtledoves according to the Law, and the Child must be circumcised and be given the name which was made known to you and Mary.
CJ|0|23|4|0|And after the circumcision come back here again and remain here, until I shall let you know when and where you shall go from here.
CJ|0|23|5|0|You, Joseph, will in fact be ready to take your departure before then, but I must tell you - you will not leave here one pulse-beat sooner than it is the will of Him who is with you in the cave!'
CJ|0|23|6|0|After these words the angel disappeared, and Joseph went over to Mary and made this known to her.
CJ|0|23|7|0|And Mary replied to Joseph, 'See, I am always just a handmaiden of the Lord, so let it be done to me according to His word!
CJ|0|23|8|0|For I had a dream today, and in this dream everything happened that you now made known to me, so be concerned only for the pair of doves, and on the eighth day I shall go with you in good cheer to the city of the Lord!'
CJ|0|23|9|0|Soon after the angel's appearance the captain again came for a morning visit, and Joseph let him know at once why he would have to go to Jerusalem on the eighth day.
CJ|0|23|10|0|The captain immediately offered Joseph all possible aid and wanted to provide him with a guide to Jerusalem.
CJ|0|23|11|0|But Joseph thanked him for his splendid good will and said, 'See, it is the will of my Lord and God that I should go to Jerusalem just as I came here!
CJ|0|23|12|0|Thus I will also undertake the short journey in that way, so the Lord will not chastise me for my disobedience.
CJ|0|23|13|0|But since you want to do something for me on this occasion, then provide me with two turtledoves, which are to be offered up in the temple, and look after this dwelling place for me!
CJ|0|23|14|0|For on the ninth day I shall return and shall stay as long as the Lord will require it of me.'
CJ|0|23|15|0|Cornelius promised Joseph to provide all that was asked, then left and himself brought Joseph a newly-made dove house full of turtledoves, from which Joseph had to select the comeliest pair.
CJ|0|23|16|0|After that the captain returned to his duties, in the meantime leaving the dovehouse in the cave until evening, when he called for it himself.
CJ|0|23|17|0|And on the eighth day, when Joseph had gone to Jerusalem, Cornelius had a guard placed in front of the cave, which allowed no one to go in and out except the two oldest sons left behind by Joseph, and also Salome, who provided them with food and drink, for the midwife went along to Jerusalem.
CJ|0|24|1|1|The Baby Is Circumcised In The Temple
CJ|0|24|1|0|ON THE AFTERNOON of the eighth day - about the third hour according to present-day calculation - the Baby was circumcised in the temple and was given the name 'Jesus', which the angel had spoken before the Baby was conceived in the womb.
CJ|0|24|2|0|And since in the most exceptional case of Mary's proven virginity the time for her cleansing was considered fulfilled, Mary was promptly cleansed in the temple.
CJ|0|24|3|0|Therefore Mary took the Baby upon her arm soon after the circumcision and carried Him into the temple, so she together with Joseph might present Him to the Lord according to the Law of Moses.
CJ|0|24|4|0|As it is also written in the Law of God: 'All manner of first-born shall be dedicated to the Lord,
CJ|0|24|5|0|and for that a pair of turtledoves or a pair of young doves shall be offered as a sacrifice.'
CJ|0|24|6|0|And Mary offered a pair of turtledoves as a sacrifice and laid it on the offering table, and the priest took the offering and blessed Mary.
CJ|0|24|7|0|There was a man in Jerusalem, named Simeon, who was most devout and god-fearing and waited for the consolation of Israel, for he was filled with the Spirit of God.
CJ|0|24|8|0|To this man the Spirit of God had said: 'You shall not see the death of the body before you see Jesus, the Anointed of God, the Messiah of the world!'
CJ|0|24|9|0|Therefore he now came into the temple out of an inner prompting while Joseph and Mary were still in the temple where they were doing all that the Law required.
CJ|0|24|10|0|And when he beheld the Baby, he went right over to the parents and entreated them to let him take Him on his arms for a little while.
CJ|0|24|11|0|The most devout pair gladly obliged the old, above all devout man whom they knew well.
CJ|0|24|12|0|And Simeon took the Baby in his arms and caressed Him, while he fervently praised God and finally said:
CJ|0|24|13|0|'Lord, now let Your servant go in peace, as You have spoken,
CJ|0|24|14|0|for my eyes have now seen the Savior whom You have promised to the fathers and the prophets!
CJ|0|24|15|0|This is He, whom You have prepared before all nations!
CJ|0|24|16|0|A light to shine the heathen, a light to the honor of Your people Israel!'
CJ|0|24|17|0|Joseph and Mary were themselves surprised at the words of Simeon, for they did not understand at that time that he had testified about the Child.
CJ|0|24|18|0|Simeon now gave the Baby back to Mary, thereupon blessed both and then said to Mary:
CJ|0|24|19|0|'Behold, this One will be set for the fall and rise of many in Israel and for a sign that will be spoken  against!
CJ|0|24|20|0|And a sword will pierce your soul, so the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed!'
CJ|0|24|21|0|Mary did not understand Simeon's words, but kept them deep in her heart.
CJ|0|24|22|0|And Joseph did the same and mightily glorified and praised God therefore in his heart.
CJ|0|25|1|1|The Testimony Of A Prophetess
CJ|0|25|1|0|AT THIS TIME there was a prophetess in the temple, named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher.
CJ|0|25|2|0|She was already very old and was so devout, that when in her youth she became espoused to a man, she so loved God that she did not reveal herself to her husband for seven years and during this time retained her virginity.
CJ|0|25|3|0|She became a widow in her eightieth year, thereupon entered the temple and did not depart from it any more.
CJ|0|25|4|0|Here she served the Lord God alone in prayer and fasting day and night from her own free will.
CJ|0|25|5|0|On this occasion she had already been in the temple for four years and now also came over, praised the Lord God and then told all who awaited the Savior in Jerusalem what the Spirit of God revealed to her.
CJ|0|25|6|0|When she had finished her prophetic words, she also asked for the Baby, caressed Him, and praised and glorified God.
CJ|0|25|7|0|After that she gave the Baby back to Mary and said to her: 'Happy and blessed are you, oh maiden, that you are the mother of my Lord!
CJ|0|25|8|0|But do not ever allow yourself to desire praise on that account, for only That, which there sucks at your breast, is alone worthy to be honored, praised and worshiped by all of us!'
CJ|0|25|9|0|After these words the prophetess left, and Joseph and Mary, who had been in the temple about three hours, left it again and sought lodging with a relative.
CJ|0|25|10|0|But when they arrived there they found the house locked, for the relative this time also happened to be in Bethlehem to be recorded.
CJ|0|25|11|0|Joseph did not know what to do now, for the night was fully upon him, as was to be expected during this time of shortest days - besides, hardly a house was still open at this hour, and that all the more so because it was the evening before the Sabbath.
CJ|0|25|12|0|It was too cold to spend the night out in the open, for the frost lay on the fields and a cold wind blew besides.
CJ|0|25|13|0|While Joseph considered back and forth and asked the Lord to help him out of this distress,
CJ|0|25|14|0|behold, suddenly there came a young, refined Israelite toward Joseph and asked him, 'What are you doing on the street so late with your baggage? Are you not also an Israelite - and do not know the custom?'
CJ|0|25|15|0|Joseph answered, 'See, I am of the tribe of David! I was in the temple and made an offering to the Lord; but the early night has overtaken me, and now I can find no shelter and am in great distress because of my wife and her Child!'
CJ|0|25|16|0|Here the young Israelite said to Joseph, 'So then come with me and I will rent you a lodging until tomorrow for a piece of silver or its equivalent.
CJ|0|25|17|0|And Joseph with Mary, who was on the donkey, and will his three sons followed the Israelite into a magnificent house and there took lodging in a small room with a low ceiling.
CJ|0|26|1|1|Nicodemus Beholds The Glory Of God
CJ|0|26|1|0|THE FOLLOWING MORNING when Joseph was ready to depart for Bethlehem, there came the young Israelite intending to request the piece of silver.
CJ|0|26|2|0|But as he came into the room, such a great fear suddenly came upon him that he was unable to utter a sound.
CJ|0|26|3|0|Joseph then went over to him and said, 'Friend, see, whatever I have that you feel is worth a piece of silver, that take, for I have no money in my possession!'
CJ|0|26|4|0|The Israelite now recovered somewhat and said in a quaking voice, 'Man of Nazareth, now I know who you are! You are Joseph the carpenter, and are the same to whom Mary, the maiden of the Lord, was allotted from the temple nine months ago.
CJ|0|26|5|0|Here is the same maiden! How did you watch over her, since she is now a mother in her fifteenth year? How did that happen?
CJ|0|26|6|0|Truly, you are not the father! For men of your age and of your fear of God, which is acknowledged in all Israel, never do such a thing.
CJ|0|26|7|0|But you have grown-up sons - can you vouch for their innocence? Did you keep an eye on them constantly and did you watch over all their thoughts, actions, comings and goings?'
CJ|0|26|8|0|At this Joseph countered the young man and said, 'Now I recognize you too. You are Nicodemus, a son of Benjamin from the tribe of Levi! How is it that you undertake to examine me, when it is not your place to do so? Now the Lord has examined me therein in the sanctuary and on the accursed mountain and has justified me before the high council. What guilt would you then find on me and my sons?
CJ|0|26|9|0|Go into the temple and examine the high council, and a proper witness concerning my whole house will be given you!'
CJ|0|26|10|0|These words went deep into the heart of the wealthy young man, and he declared, 'But in heaven's name, if that is the way it is, then tell me how it happened that this maiden gave birth in this manner! Was it a miracle, or did it happen naturally?'
CJ|0|26|11|0|Here the also present midwife went over to Nicodemus and asserted, 'Man! Here is the piece of silver for the very meager lodging! Now do not detain us any longer in vain, for we must arrive in Bethlehem still today!
CJ|0|26|12|0|But consider what That is, which today was meagerly lodged in your house for one piece of silver! Truly, truly, your most splendid rooms which are decorated with gold and precious stones would be too mean for such glory of God lodged here in this room, which at best is suitable for convicts!
CJ|0|26|13|0|Now go over and touch the Baby, so the coarse mantle may fall from your eyes and you may see who visited you! As the midwife I have the ancient right to give you permission to touch the Baby.'
CJ|0|26|14|0|Nicodemus now went over and touched the Baby - and when he touched Him, his inner vision was opened for a short time and he beheld the glory of God.
CJ|0|26|15|0|He thereupon fell down before the Child and worshiped Him and said: 'What grace and what compassion must be in You, o Lord, that You visit Your people like this!
CJ|0|26|16|0|And what shall I now have done with my house, and what with me, since I have thus failed to recognize the glory of God?'
CJ|0|26|17|0|Here the midwife said, 'Remain in everything as you are, but be altogether silent about what you have seen, or you will come under the judgment of God!'- Thereupon Nicodemus returned the piece of silver, then went outside weeping and afterward had this side room decorated with gold and precious stones. And Joseph promptly began his journey.
CJ|0|27|1|1|Away In A Manger, No Crib For His Bed
CJ|0|27|1|0|TOWARDS EVENING, still an hour before sunset, the eminent travelers again reached Bethlehem and moved into the familiar cave.
CJ|0|27|2|0|The two sons who remained behind, Salome, and the captain greeted them with open arms and most concernedly asked the returnees how they had fared on the journey.
CJ|0|27|3|0|And Joseph told all that had taken place and finally also admitted that he and all those traveling with him still had not had anything to eat on this day, for the very meager supply of food had hardly been enough for the weak Mary.
CJ|0|27|4|0|When the captain heard Joseph say this, he promptly went to the back of the cave and brought back a number of foodstuffs permissible to the Jews and then said to Joseph,
CJ|0|27|5|0|'Here, may your God bless it for you, and do you also bless it according to your custom, and all of you still your hunger and restore yourselves herewith.'
CJ|0|27|6|0|Joseph then thanked God, blessed the food and in good spirits ate with Mary and his sons and the midwife.
CJ|0|27|7|0|Now the Baby had become heavy for Mary from carrying Him all day, so she said to Joseph,
CJ|0|27|8|0|'Joseph, see, if I only had a little place beside me where to lay the Baby, to give my arms a little rest, then I would be provided for in everything, and the Baby Himself could become stronger with more restful sleep.'
CJ|0|27|9|0|No sooner had the captain finished hearing Mary's wish when he promptly sprang into the rear of of the cave and quickly brought out a small manger which was for the use of the sheep.
CJ|0|27|10|0|Salome quickly took the best straw and fresh hay, filled out the little manger with it, then covered it with a fresh piece of cloth and thus made a soft little bed for the Baby.
CJ|0|27|11|0|And Mary wrapped the Baby in fresh linen, pressed Him to her bosom, kissed Him, then gave Him to Joseph and also to all the others to be kissed and then laid into the indeed very shabby little bed for the Lord of heaven and earth.
CJ|0|27|12|0|The Baby slept very quietly, and Mary could now eat undisturbedly and restore herself at the meal which the very good-hearted captain had prepared for them.
CJ|0|27|13|0|After the meal Mary again said to Joseph, 'Joseph, have my resting place made ready, for I am exhausted from the trip and therefore would like to retire.'
CJ|0|27|14|0|Salome told her, 'Oh mother of my Lord, that has long been attended to in the best way - come and see.'
CJ|0|27|15|0|Here Mary arose, again took the Baby and also had the little crib carried into her tent and went to rest, and that was the first whole night's sleep for Mary since she gave birth.
CJ|0|27|16|0|And the captain saw to it that the hearth was diligently heated and had white stones warmed and placed around Mary's tent so she with the Child would be sure not to suffer from the cold; for this was a cold night, in which the water out in the open turned to solid ice.
CJ|0|28|1|1|The Magi Are Received By Herod
CJ|0|28|1|0|THE FOLLOWING MORNING Joseph said, 'Why should we remain here any longer? Mary is well again, so let us set out to where we have our regular accommodations!'
CJ|0|28|2|0|But just as Joseph was getting ready to make his departure, the captain, who had already attended to some business in the town before daybreak, returned and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|28|3|0|'Worthy man of God! You want to set out on your homeward journey, but I advise you against it for today, tomorrow and the day after that!
CJ|0|28|4|0|See, I have just heard through my men, who arrived from Jerusalem very early this morning, that three mighty Persian caravans have entered Jerusalem!
CJ|0|28|5|0|Three leaders of highest rank as Magi have made most pressing inquiries of Herod concerning the newborn King of the Jews!
CJ|0|28|6|0|The latter, who as a Roman tenant sovereign from Greece knew nothing of the matter, turned to the high priests so they might inform him where the newly Anointed should be born.
CJ|0|28|7|0|And these informed him that such were to take place in Judea, namely in Bethlehem, for so it were written.
CJ|0|28|8|0|'Thereupon Herod dismissed the priests and with his entire retinue went to the three leaders and informed them of what he had ascertained from the high priest,
CJ|0|28|9|0|and then bid the three to look for the newly Anointed of the Jews in Judea with all diligence and, when they should find Him, to promptly return to him without fail, so he too might come and do homage to the Child.
CJ|0|28|10|0|But do you know, my very dear friend Joseph, that I trust neither the Persians, and least of all that beyond all measure tyrannical Herod!
CJ|0|28|11|0|The Persians are said to be Magi and are said to have discovered the birth through a strange star. I do not seek to question that at all; for if such great wonders have become manifest here at the birth of this little Boy, then this can also have happened in Persia.
CJ|0|28|12|0|But that is just the most critical circumstance in the matter, for it obviously concerns this Child! If the Persians find Him, then Herod will also find Him,
CJ|0|28|13|0|and we will then have to exercise all our wits to get out of the claws of the old fox!
CJ|0|28|14|0|Therefore you must, as already said, remain here in this out-of-the-way place for at least three more days, in which time I will surely be able to give the matter a turn for the better as concerns the seekers of the King, for you see, I am in command here of twelve legions of soldiers! More I do not need to tell you for your peace of mind. Now you know what is necessary, so stay! I am leaving again now and will return to you around noon.'
CJ|0|28|15|0|Joseph, intimidated along with his family by this news, remained and awaited the Lord's will in all resignation to see what would come of this strange turn of events.
CJ|0|28|16|0|And when he told Mary what he had just heard from the captain,
CJ|0|28|17|0|Mary replied,'The Lord's will be done! How many bitter things have we experienced up to now - and the Lord has changed them all into honey!
CJ|0|28|18|0|Surely the Persians will not harm us either if they should really come to see us, and if they should desire to use any sort of mercenary force on us, we then have the captain's protection through the grace of God!'
CJ|0|28|19|0|Joseph said, 'Mary, all that is in the best order! I do not fear the Persians too much either, but the greybearded Herod, that rending animal in human form, he it is whom I fear, and the captain also has an aversion of him.
CJ|0|28|20|0|For in the event it is proved through the Persians that our little Boy is the newly anointed King, then nothing will remain for us but abject flight!
CJ|0|28|21|0|For then our captain also, because of Roman reasons of state, will have to become our enemy for the sake of his own salvation and instead of saving us will have to persecute us if he does not wish to be regarded as disloyal to the emperor!
CJ|0|28|22|0|And that he must surely realize privately, since he himself made known his anything but small misgivings concerning Herod to me.
CJ|0|28|23|0|For that reason, I would say, he is having us wait here for three more days! If matters go well, he will surely remain our friend,
CJ|0|28|24|0|but if things go badly, he already has us at hand to deliver us to the cruelty of Herod, and in addition will receive a great decoration from his emperor for it because he in such a clever way removed a Jewish King from the world who one day might become dangerous to the state!'
CJ|0|28|25|0|And Mary said: 'Joseph! Do not bring useless anxiety on' yourself and on me! See, we did drink the accursed water, and no harm came upon me! Why then should we be afraid now, since we have already seen and confirmed so much of God's glory on account of this Child?
CJ|0|28|26|0|Come what may, I tell you - the Lord is mightier than the Persians, Herod, the emperor of Rome and the captain along with his twelve legions! So be calm, as you see that I am calm.
CJ|0|28|27|0|And besides, I am convinced that the captain will first leave no stone unturned before he would become our enemy from force of circumstance!'
CJ|0|28|28|0|At this the good and devout Joseph regained his composure, awaited the captain and in the meantime had his sons heat the cave and cook a few fruits for Mary, himself and the sons.
CJ|0|29|1|1|A Stranger Star O'er Bethlehem
CJ|0|29|1|0|THE NOON-HOUR CAME, but this time the captain failed to arrive. And Joseph counted the moments in worried expectation, but the captain failed to appear.
CJ|0|29|2|0|Thereupon Joseph turned to the Lord and pleaded, 'My Lord and my God, I beg You not to let me be tormented so much in my soul - see, I am old and fairly weak in all my joints.
CJ|0|29|3|0|Therefore strengthen me by letting me know what to do, so I shall not come to shame before all the sons of Israel!'
CJ|0|29|4|0|When Joseph had thus prayed, behold, there came the captain almost out of breath and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|29|5|0|'Man in my highest esteem! I have just returned from a march which I made with an entire legion nearly a third of the way to Jerusalem to detect something of the Persians,
CJ|0|29|6|0|and have placed spies in many places, but up to now I could discover nothing. Now just be calm, for when they do come, they must encounter the sentries I have posted.
CJ|0|29|7|0|Then they shall not have an easy time in breaking through anywhere and in arriving here before I have not cross-examined them and tested their intentions. Therefore I am leaving again at once and shall increase the sentries - in the evening I shall be with you!'
CJ|0|29|8|0|The captain now hastened away again, and Joseph praised God and said to his sons, 'Now set the food on the table, and you, Salome, ask Mary if she wants to eat at the table with us, or whether we shall bring the food to her couch?'
CJ|0|29|9|0|Here Mary with the Baby came out of her tent in a happy mood and said, 'Since I am strong enough, I will eat with you at the table - only bring the little crib here for the Baby!'
CJ|0|29|10|0|Joseph was full of joy at this and put the best morsels in front of Mary, and they praised the Lord God and ate and drank.
CJ|0|29|11|0|Now they had just finished eating, when behold, a loud commotion suddenly arose in front of the cave. At this Joseph sent Joel to see what was going on.
CJ|0|29|12|0|And when Joel looked out of the door (for the cave was timbered at the exit), he saw a whole caravan of Persians with packed camels and reported in a frightened voice,
CJ|0|29|13|0|'Father Joseph, in heaven's name, we are lost! Just look, the notorious Persians are here with many camels and a great number of attendants!
CJ|0|29|14|0|They are putting up their tents and are encamping in a wide circle sealing off our cave, and three leaders decorated with gold, silver and precious stones are unpacking golden bags and show signs of wanting to enter the cave!'
CJ|0|29|15|0|This report almost robbed Joseph of his power of speech. With great effort he managed to bring out the words, 'Lord, be gracious to me a poor sinner! Yes, now we are lost!' - And Mary took the Baby, hurried into her tent with Him and cried out, 'Only when I am dead will you tear Him away from me!' -
CJ|0|29|16|0|Then Joseph, led by his sons, went over to the door and stealthily looked out to see what the Persians were doing.
CJ|0|29|17|0|But when he saw the great caravan and the erected tents he was doubly afraid in his heart and began to plead fervently with the Lord to help him out of such great distress, if only this once.
CJ|0|29|18|0|While he was thus pleading, behold, there arrived the captain in full martial armor, led by a thousand warriors, and posted warriors at both sides of the cave,
CJ|0|29|19|0|then went over and asked the three Magi why they had come and how - by him thus fully unnoticed - they had arrived at this place.
CJ|0|29|20|0|And the three answered the captain in one voice: 'Consider us anything but enemies, for you can see that we are unarmed, nor do we carry concealed weapons with us!
CJ|0|29|21|0|For we are astronomers from Persia, and we have an old prophecy in which it is written that in this time a King of Kings will be born to the Jews, and His birth will be manifest by a star;
CJ|0|29|22|0|and that those who see the star should undertake a journey and go where the mighty star will lead them, for they will find the Savior of the world where the star will take its stand!
CJ|0|29|23|0|And behold, above this stable stands the star, surely visible to everyone even in the full of day! The same was our guide to this place where it stood still above this stable, and we without any hindrance safely reached the spot where the wonder of wonders is present alive, a new-born Child, a King of Kings, a Lord of Lords from eternity!
CJ|0|29|24|0|The Same we must see, worship and bring Him the greatest homage! So do not in any event want to bar our way, for surely no evil star has led us hither!'
CJ|0|29|25|0|At this the captain looked for the star and was greatly surprised thereat, for it not only stood quite low, but its light was nearly as strong as the natural light of the sun.
CJ|0|29|26|0|When the captain had ascertained all this he said to the three, 'Good, I have now become convinced from your words and by the star that you have come here with good intentions, but I just cannot see what you first had to do in Jerusalem with Herod! Did the star also show you the way there?
CJ|0|29|27|0|Why did your marvelous guide not lead you here directly, since after all the place of your destination is here and not Jerusalem? - About that I still demand an answer from you, or you will not get into the cave!'
CJ|0|29|28|0|The three replied, 'The great God will know that! Surely it must be part of His plan, for none of us had ever even considered going anywhere near Jerusalem!
CJ|0|29|29|0|And you can altogether believe us - we were not at all pleased with the people in Jerusalem, and least of all with the sovereign Herod! But since we were already there and the attention of the whole city was directed at us, we just had to show what our intention was.
CJ|0|29|30|0|The priests gave us information through the sovereign, who asked us to bring him tidings about the new King, so he might also come and bring Him his homage.'
CJ|0|29|31|0|And the captain said, 'That you will never do, for I know the intention of this sovereign! Rather than that you will remain here as hostages! - I am now going inside and will confer with the father of the Child about you.'
CJ|0|30|1|1|The Magi Worship The Baby
CJ|0|30|1|0|WHEN THE GOOD JOSEPH heard all this, his oppressed heart became lighter, and since he heard that the captain would come to him, he prepared himself to receive him.
CJ|0|30|2|0|The captain entered, greeted Joseph and said to him, 'Man in my highest esteem!
CJ|0|30|3|0|See, by a wondrous providence these visitors from the East now waiting outside have come here, and I have examined them strictly and found no malice in them.
CJ|0|30|4|0|They wish to pay homage to the Child according to the promise of their God, and I am of the opinion that you can let them enter without having the least fear, if it is convenient for you.'
CJ|0|30|5|0|Joseph replied, 'If that is the way it is, then I will praise and glorify my God, for He has again taken a heavy stone from my heart!
CJ|0|30|6|0|But a short time ago Mary became a bit terrified when the Persians began to encamp about this cave; therefore I will first have to see how matters stand with her, so an unexpected entry of these guests will not frighten her still more than she was already frightened of them.'
CJ|0|30|7|0|The captain agreed to Joseph's precaution, and Joseph went to Mary and informed her of everything that he heard from the captain.
CJ|0|30|8|0|And Mary replied in a happy mood, 'Peace to all people on earth who are of a good and faithful heart and allow their will to be led by God!
CJ|0|30|9|0|They are surely welcome when the Spirit of the Lord will indicate it, and shall reap the blessing of their faithfulness! For I am not in the least afraid of them.
CJ|0|30|10|0|But when they enter you will have to stand close by my side, for it just would not be proper for me to receive them in this tent by myself!'
CJ|0|30|11|0|Joseph answered, 'Mary, If you are strong enough, then arise with the Child and lay Him in the crib before you, and the guests can enter to give the Child their homage!'
CJ|0|30|12|0|Mary promptly fulfilled Joseph's wish, and Joseph told the captain,
CJ|0|30|13|0|'See, we are ready; if the three wish to enter, you can tell them that we are prepared to receive them in our poverty!'
CJ|0|30|14|0|Hereupon the captain went outside and made this known to the Magi. - At this the three fell down to the earth, praised God for this permission, then took the golden bags and full of reverence went to the cave.
CJ|0|30|15|0|The captain opened the door, and the three entered the cave in greatest awe - for at the moment they entered, a powerful light emanated from the Child.
CJ|0|30|16|0|And when the wise men came close to the little crib wherein the Baby lay, they fell down on their faces and worshiped the Same.
CJ|0|30|17|0|For an hour long they lay before the Child, stirred and humbled in the highest veneration. Then they slowly arose and while kneeling raised up their tearful faces and gazed upon the Lord, the Creator of infinity and eternity.
CJ|0|30|18|0|And the names of the three were: Chaspara, Melcheor and Balthehasara.
CJ|0|30|19|0|And the first, accompanied by the spirit of Adam, affirmed: To God alone the honor, the glory, and the praise! Hosanna, Hosanna to God, the triune One from eternity to eternity!'
CJ|0|30|20|0|Hereupon he took the purse woven of golden threads which held thirty-three pounds of the finest incense, and in greatest deference gave it to Mary with the words,
CJ|0|30|21|0|'Take without shyness, oh mother, this insignificant witness of That with which my whole being will be filled forever! Take the poor outward tribute which every thinking being owes to his almighty Creator from the bottom of His heart forever!'
CJ|0|30|22|0|Mary then took the heavy purse and gave it to Joseph, and the donor arose, went over to the door and again knelt down and worshiped the Lord in the Child.
CJ|0|30|23|0|And the second, who was a Moor and was accompanied by the spirit of Cain, lifted up a somewhat smaller purse but of the same weight, filled with purest gold, and gave it to Mary with the words:
CJ|0|30|24|0|'What is fitting for the King of spirits and mankind on earth, I here bring a smallest offering of to You, o Lord of glory forever! Take it, oh mother, you who have given birth to What the tongues of all the angels will eternally never be able to express!'
CJ|0|30|25|0|Here Mary took the second purse and gave it to Joseph. And the wise man who made the offering arose and went over to the first and did as he did.
CJ|0|30|26|0|Then the third arose and took his purse, filled with the very finest goldmyrrh, in that day one of the most precious spices, and gave it to Mary with the words:
CJ|0|30|27|0|'The Spirit of Abraham accompanies me and now sees the day of the Lord, which he has looked forward to with such great joy!
CJ|0|30|28|0|And I, Balthehasara, here offer up in a small gift what is fitting for the Child of all children! Take it, oh mother of all grace. But my breast conceals a better offering: it is my love - this shall eternally be a most genuine offering to this Child!'
CJ|0|30|29|0|At this Mary took the purse which also weighed thirty-three pounds and gave it to Joseph. The wise man then also arose and went over to the first two, worshiped the Baby, and after completing his prayer went outside with them to their tents.
CJ|0|31|1|1|Joseph Tells Of God's Three Greatest Gifts
CJ|0|31|1|0|AFTER THE THREE wise men had gone to their tents, Mary said to Joseph,
CJ|0|31|2|0|'See, now just see, you fearful, worried man, how wonderful and good the Lord our God is and how he provides for us in an ever so fatherly way.
CJ|0|31|3|0|Which of us could ever have dreamed of anything like that? Out of our great fright He was wrought a great blessing and has changed all our great worry and fear into such great joy!
CJ|0|31|4|0|For just from those who we feared might seek after the life of the Child did we find out that they only brought Him an honor in a manner worthy of our eternal indebtedness to the Lord God,
CJ|0|31|5|0|and in addition have presented us with such rich gifts that for their value we can buy a handsome place in the country for our very own, where we will surely be able to bring up the divine Child in the best possible way according to the Lord's will.
CJ|0|31|6|0|Oh Joseph, beginning today I will thank the most loving Lord and honor and praise Him the whole night through, for He has now anticipated us in our poverty to such an extent that we can provide for ourselves quite amply! What do you say to that, dear father Joseph?'
CJ|0|31|7|0|And Joseph answered: 'Yes, Mary, the Lord God is infinitely good to those who love Him above all else and place all their hopes in Him alone, but I would say that these gifts are not for us but for the Child, therefore we do not have the right to use them as we please.
CJ|0|31|8|0|Now the Child's name is Jesus, and He is a Son of the most High, so we must first ask the above all exalted Father what is to be done with  these treasures!
CJ|0|31|9|0|And what He directs to be done therewith that we will also do, but without His will I will not touch them as long as I live and will rather earn a blessed piece of bread for you and me in the most difficult way in the world.
CJ|0|31|10|0|I have provided for you and my sons until now by the blessed toil of my hands, and I will be able to continue to do so with the help of the Lord!
CJ|0|31|11|0|Therefore I do not look to these gifts but only to the will of the Lord and to His grace and love.
CJ|0|31|12|0|'These are the three greatest gifts of God which always give us a mighty blessing! His holy will is the most precious incense to me, His grace the purest, heaviest gold, and His love the above all things precious myrrh.
CJ|0|31|13|0|We may always spend these three treasures quite lavishly, but this incense, this gold and this myrrh there in the golden bags we may not touch without first possessing the three main treasures which have always paid us the richest dividends up to now.
CJ|0|31|14|0|So let us take care of it that way, dear Mary, and I know the Lord will look on us with approval for it, and may His approval be our greatest treasure!
CJ|0|31|15|0|What do you think, most gracious Mary, am I right or not? Is this not the best way to handle these treasures?'
CJ|0|31|16|0|Here Mary was touched to tears and praised Joseph's wisdom. And the captain fell about Joseph's neck and asserted, 'Yes, you are still an ideal human being after the will of your God!' - And the Baby smilingly looked at Joseph, lifted a little hand and acted as if He blessed Joseph, the most devout paternal provider.
CJ|0|32|1|1|Joseph Reassures Cornelius
CJ|0|32|1|0|THE THREE WISE MEN now came together in a tent and counseled what they should do next.
CJ|0|32|2|0|Should they keep the word they gave Herod, or should they here break their word for the first time?
CJ|0|32|3|0|If they should go back to their country by another route, it was to be questioned which one would safely bring them back to their country again.
CJ|0|32|4|0|So one asked the other, 'Do you suppose the wonderful star that led us hither will also lead us home again over another route?'
CJ|0|32|5|0|While they were thus counseling together, behold, suddenly an angel came among them and said to them, 'Do no concern yourselves vainly, for the way is already laid out!
CJ|0|32|6|0|As directly as the sun's rays fall on the earth at noonday, just that directly shall you be led into your country commencing tomorrow, and by another route than by way of Jerusalem.'
CJ|0|32|7|0|Thereupon the angel disappeared and the three went to rest. And early in the morning they departed with a sure faith in the only God and soon returned to their homeland by the shortest route.
CJ|0|32|8|0|On the same morning Joseph asked the captain how much longer he would still have to remain in the cave.
CJ|0|32|9|0|Here the captain said to Joseph in a most friendly manner, 'Man in my highest esteem! Do you suppose that I am keeping you here like a prisoner?
CJ|0|32|10|0|Oh what a thought! How should I, a worm in the dust before the power of your God, ever hold you a prisoner? But what my love for you does, see, that certainly is not imprisonment.
CJ|0|32|11|0|As far as my power is concerned you are free at any hour and can go where you wish. But you are not that free as far as my heart is concerned, which would indeed like to hold you here for all time - for it loves you and your little Son with a power that is indescribable!
CJ|0|32|12|0|Now just sit still for a couple of days and I will send scouts to Jerusalem right away to find out what that gray fox will do when he finds out that the Persians have not kept their word to him!
CJ|0|32|13|0|Then I will know what steps to take and will shield you from every persecution of this frenzied tyrant.
CJ|0|32|14|0|For you can believe me: this Herod is the greatest enemy of my heart and I am determined to smite him when and wherever I can!
CJ|0|32|15|0|I am of course only a captain and am only a subordinate myself to the higher commander who resides in Sidon and Smyrna and has command over twelve legions in Asia.
CJ|0|32|16|0|Still I am no common centurion but am a partrician and by virtue of my rank am therefore also in command of the twelve legions in Asia. If I want to make use of one or the other, I need not first get permission from Smyrna, but as a patrician need only to command, and the legion must obey me! Hence you can count on me if Herod should rise up!'
CJ|0|32|17|0|Joseph thanked the captain for this most friendly concern but then added the following,
CJ|0|32|18|0|'Hear me now, highly honored friend! See, just the other day you also concerned yourself in all watchfulness with the Persians, but what good did all that do you?
CJ|0|32|19|0|The Persians came unseen by all your thousand eyes and had their camp set up long before you could discover even one of them.
CJ|0|32|20|0|See, if the Lord my God had not protected me there, where would I be even now with your help? Before you appeared the Persians could long have strangled me along with my family!
CJ|0|32|21|0|Therefore I now say to you as a friend filled with the warmest gratitude: Human help is of no use, for all men are nothing before God!
CJ|0|32|22|0|And if the Lord God wants to help us and He alone can help, then we should not go to much trouble, for despite all our effort everything will happen just as the Lord wants - but never the way we want it!
CJ|0|32|23|0|Hence refrain from the difficult and dangerous gathering of information in Jerusalem, through which in the first place you probably would find out little of value and secondly, if it became known, it could prepare a bitter lot for you on my account.
CJ|0|32|24|0|Besides, the Lord will surely let me know this night what Herod will do and what I will have to do, so you can be quite at ease along with me and let the Lord alone have the say over me and you, and everything will be for the best!'
CJ|0|32|25|0|When the captain heard these words from Joseph, he was stirred up in his heart and it hurt him that Joseph had declined his help.
CJ|0|32|26|0|Here Joseph said: 'My good, very dear friend, you are hurt because I "advised you against concerning yourself further for my welfare.
CJ|0|32|27|0|But if you look at the matter in a clear light, you must necessarily come to the same conclusion!
CJ|0|32|28|0|See, which of us has ever carried the sun and the moon and all the stars through the vault of heaven? Which of us has ever commanded the winds, storms and lightnings?
CJ|0|32|29|0|Who has dug the mighty ocean its bed? Which of us determined the course of the great rivers?
CJ|0|32|30|0|Which bird have we taught its rapid flight and when did we give it its plumage? When did we form its throat so rich in melody?
CJ|0|32|31|0|Just where does the grass stand for which we formed the living seed?
CJ|0|32|32|0|See, all that the Lord does every day! - Now if His mighty and wonderful rule reminds you of His immeasurably great love and concern at every moment, why should it seem strange to you if I in a most friendly manner call your attention to the fact that before God all human help sinks back into the dust of nothingness?'
CJ|0|32|33|0|These words restored the captain to a more receptive mood, but for all that he still sent scouts to Jerusalem secretly to find out what was taking place there.
CJ|0|33|1|1|Preparations For The Flight To Egypt
CJ|0|33|1|0|DURING THE NIGHT an angel appeared in a dream to Joseph as well as to Mary and said:
CJ|0|33|2|0|'Joseph, sell the treasures and buy a few more beasts of burden for yourself, for you must flee to Egypt with your family!
CJ|0|33|3|0|See, Herod has burst into a mighty rage and has resolved to murder all children from the first to twelve years of age because he was tricked by the wise men!
CJ|0|33|4|0|These are supposed to have informed him where the new King was born, so he then could have sent out his myrmidons who were to have murdered the Child, which is the new King.
CJ|0|33|5|0|But we angels of the heavens have been instructed by the Lord still before He came into the world to watch mos concernedly over everything that has to do with your safety.
CJ|0|33|6|0|And for that reason I now came to you to inform you what Herod will do, since he cannot be certain of get-ting hold of the One he wants.
CJ|0|33|7|0|The captain himself will have to be instrumental to Herod if he does not want to be betrayed to the emperor by him, and for that reason you shall start on your journey even tomorrow!
CJ|0|33|8|0|You can also let the captain know this, and he will assist you in making a speedy departure! - So be it in the name of Him who lives and sucks the breasts of Mary!'
CJ|0|33|9|0|Here Joseph awoke, and so did Mary, who immediately called Joseph over in a frightened tone of voice and told him her dream.
CJ|0|33|10|0|Joseph thereupon saw his vision confirmed in Mary's story and assured her, 'Mary, do not worry, before noon we will be across the hills - and in seven days in Egypt!
CJ|0|33|11|0|Now, since dawn is here already, I will go outside at once and put everything in order for a quick departure.'
CJ|0|33|12|0|Joseph with his three oldest sons now took the treasures and carried them to a moneychanger, who quickly opened the door and redeemed everything from him for the proper amount.
CJ|0|33|13|0|Then Joseph, led by a servant of the money-changer, went to a trader in pack animals and promptly bought six more pack donkeys and thus well equipped returned to the cave.
CJ|0|33|14|0|There the captain already awaited him and at once told him of the most cruel and abominable reports that had come to him from Jerusalem.
CJ|0|33|15|0|Joseph was not greatly surprised at the captain's story and said in a voice resigned to God,
CJ|0|33|16|0|'Honored friend, as I foretold you yesterday, all that you now tell me, and in much greater clarity, the Lord made known to me last night concerning all that Herod has resolved.
CJ|0|33|17|0|See, in addition you will have to assist him yourself, for he wants to have all children in the vicinity of Bethlehem and in the town itself slaughtered into the twelfth year so that among them he might also get at mine!
CJ|0|33|18|0|Therefore I must flee from here still today to where the Spirit of the Lord will lead me away from Herod's cruelty.
CJ|0|33|19|0|For that reason I would ask you to inform me of the safe route to Sidon, for I must depart already in an hour.'
CJ|0|33|20|0|When the captain heard this, he became incensed about Herod beyond measure and swore never-ceasing revenge against him, asserting,
CJ|0|33|21|0|'Joseph, as truly as day is now beginning and the sun already stands above the horizon, as truly as your God lives, that truly will I as a noble patrician of Rome rather allow myself to be crucified before I shall let that blood-thirsty tyrant carry out such an undertaking without punishment!
CJ|0|33|22|0|I will promptly guide you across the hills myself under good protection, and once I know that you are safe, I shall hurry back and send a fast messenger to Rome, who shall inform the emperor of what Herod plans to do.
CJ|0|33|23|0|In the meantime I shall exert every possible means here to bring the intentions of that monster to naught.'
CJ|0|33|24|0|And Joseph answered, 'Honored friend! Since you are able to do something, then at least protect the children from three to twelve years! Such will be within your power!
CJ|0|33|25|0|But the little children from birth on into the second year you will not be able to protect.
CJ|0|33|26|0|And the first-mentioned protection you will not be able to accomplish by force either, but only by means of discretion.
CJ|0|33|27|0|The Lord will lead you in the use of such discretion! Therefore do not think much about what you will do, for the Lord will lead you in secret!'
CJ|0|33|28|0|At this the captain exclaimed, 'No, no, the children's blood shall not flow - rather than that I will use military force!'
CJ|0|33|29|0|Here Joseph advised, 'See, what after all can you do, for right now Herod is leaving Jerusalem with an entire Roman legion! Will you take the field against your own forces? Do therefore as the Lord will guide you, so that with a kindly manner you may still save the three-to-twelve-year-olds!' Thereupon the captain yielded.
CJ|0|34|1|1|The Journey To Tyre
CJ|0|34|1|0|AFTER THIS discussion with the captain, Joseph said to his sons, 'Bestir yourselves and load the pack animals,
CJ|0|34|2|0|then saddle the six new donkeys for me and for you and the old, tried one for Mary. Take along as much of the foodstuffs as you can, but we will leave the ox and cart here with the midwife as a keepsake and reward for taking care of us.'
CJ|0|34|3|0|Thus the ox and cart was taken over by the midwife and was not used for work henceforth.
CJ|0|34|4|0|Salome now asked Joseph if she might not go with him.
CJ|0|34|5|0|Joseph answered, 'That depends on you, but you know that I am poor and can pay you no wage if you wish to serve me.
CJ|0|34|6|0|If you have the means and can provide yourself with food and clothing along with me, you are surely welcome to come along!'
CJ|0|34|7|0|At this Salome asserted, 'Listen, son of the great king David! My wealth shall suffice for a hundred years not only for me, but for your whole family!
CJ|0|34|8|0|For I am wealthier in worldly goods than you might suppose. So wait only an hour more and I shall stand here laden with treasures, ready to go.'
CJ|0|34|9|0|Here Joseph replied, 'Salome, listen, you are a young widow and a mother, so you will also have to take your two sons along.
CJ|0|34|10|0|Now this will cause you much work and I do not have another minute to lose, for in three hours Herod will already make his entry here and his advance messengers and runners will arrive already in one hour!
CJ|0|34|11|0|From that you can see that it is impossible for me to wait until you are ready.
CJ|0|34|12|0|So I would say that you will do better if I am not held up on your account, and when according to the Lord's will I return someday, I shall make my home in Nazareth again.
CJ|0|34|13|0|Now since you would really like to be of service to me, then go to Nazareth when you get a chance and lease my farmstead for another three to seven or ten years, so it will not fall into strange hands.'
CJ|0|34|14|0|At this Salome desisted from her wish and contented herself with this task.
CJ|0|34|15|0|Joseph then embraced the captain, blessed him and then called Mary, so she with the Baby might take her place on her pack animal.
CJ|0|34|16|0|When everything had thus been prepared for the departure, the captain asked Joseph, 'Man in my highest esteem, will I ever see you and this Child with His mother again?'
CJ|0|34|17|0|And Joseph replied, 'Hardly three years will go by until I, the Child and His mother will greet you again! Be assured of that, and now let us depart. Amen.'
CJ|0|34|18|0|Here Joseph mounted his beast of burden, his sons followed his example, whereupon Joseph grasped the reins of Mary's pack animal and amid praises to the Lord led it out of the cave.
CJ|0|34|19|0|When everyone was outside, Joseph saw a great many people began to press out from the town to watch the departure of the New-Born.
CJ|0|34|20|0|This urge to stare was most inopportune for Joseph, so he asked the Lord to shield him as soon as possible from this inordinate desire of idle people to gape.
CJ|0|34|21|0|And behold, a thick fog quickly descended on the whole town and it became impossible for anyone to see even five steps ahead.
CJ|0|34|22|0|At this the crowd became vexed and withdrew into the town, and Joseph, led by the captain and Salome, was able to reach the nearest hills unseen.
CJ|0|34|23|0|When he reached the border between Judea and Syria, the captain gave Joseph a letter of safe-conduct to the governor Cyrenius, who was set over Syria.
CJ|0|34|24|0|Joseph accepted this with thanks, and the captain said, 'Cyrenius is my bother - more I need not tell you, so travel safely and return in the same manner!' Here the captain turned back with Salome, and Joseph traveled on in the name of the Lord.
CJ|0|34|25|0|About noontime Joseph reached the high point in the hills at a distance of twelve hours from Bethlehem. The high point lay wholly in Syria, which in that day was called Coelesyria by the Romans.
CJ|0|34|26|0|For Joseph had to take this more round-about way, since no safe route led from Palestine to Egypt.
CJ|0|34|27|0|And his route of travel was as follows: The first day he came into the vicinity of the little town of Bostra. There he spent the night, praising the Lord. Here it also happened that robbers came to him so they might rob him.
CJ|0|34|28|0|But when they saw the Baby, they fell on their faces worshiped Him and then fled into the hills in great fear.
CJ|0|34|29|0|The following day Joseph again crossed a massive highland and that evening arrived in the region of Panea, a little border town between Palestine and Syria to the north.
CJ|0|34|30|0|From Panea he reached the province of Phoenicia on the third day and came into the neighborhood of Tyre, where on the following day he went with his letter of safe-conduct to Cyrenius, who at that time was present in Tyre on matters of state.
CJ|0|34|31|0|Cyrenius received Joseph in a very friendly manner and asked him what he might do for him.
CJ|0|34|32|0|Joseph answered, 'That I might get to Egypt safely!' - And Cyrenius observed, 'Good man, you have taken the long way around, for Palestine is obviously much closer to Egypt than Phoenicia! Now you will have to travel through Palestine again and must go from here to Samaria, from there to Joppa, thence to Askalon, then to Gaza, from there to Geras and from there finally to Elusa in Arabia!'
CJ|0|34|33|0|Here Joseph was sad because he had thus gone astray. But Cyrenius took pity on Joseph and said, 'Good man, it pains me to see your trouble. You are, to be sure, a Jew and an enemy of the Romans - but since my brother who means everything to me likes you so well I will also do you a favor.
CJ|0|34|34|0|See, tomorrow a small but seaworthy ship leaves here for Ostracine! With it you should arrive there in three days; and once you are in Ostracine, you are already in Egypt! - And I shall give you a letter of safe-conduct with which you will be able to remain in Ostracine without hindrance and will also be able to buy yourself some property. But for today you are my guest, so have your baggage brought in.'
CJ|0|35|1|1|The Melting Of The Idols
CJ|0|35|1|0|AND JOSEPH went outside and led his family to the house where Cyrenius lived, and the latter promptly ordered his servants to provide for Joseph's pack animals,
CJ|0|35|2|0|and led Joseph with Mary and the five sons into his most ornate chamber, in which everything was lavishly decorated with gold, silver and precious stones.
CJ|0|35|3|0|Now on a table of white, very finely polished marble there stood a mass of statues about a foot in height, exceedingly well formed of Corinthian bronze.
CJ|0|35|4|0|Here Joseph asked the governor what these statues might represent.
CJ|0|35|5|0|The governor replied in a friendly manner, 'Good man, see, these are our gods! We must display them and buy them from Rome according to law, even though we do not believe in them.
CJ|0|35|6|0|I look upon them only as works of art, and in that alone do these images of the gods have some sort of nominal value to me, but otherwise I can only look upon them with the utmost disdain!'
CJ|0|35|7|0|Joseph thereupon said to Cyrenius, 'But if that is all you believe, then you are a man without God and without religion. Does that not bother your conscience?'
CJ|0|35|8|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Not in the least, for if there is no other God than these bronze ones here, then any human being is more of a god than this stupid bronze in which there is no life! Now I do believe that there is some sort of true God who is eternally alive and almighty - therefore I have only disdain for such old nonsense!'
CJ|0|35|9|0|Now Cyrenius was also a great friend of children and for that reason approached Mary, who was holding the Child in her arms, and asked her whether she were not tired from constantly carrying the Child.
CJ|0|35|10|0|And Mary said, 'Oh mighty ruler of the land! I am indeed very tired by now, but my great love to this my Child makes me forget all fatigue!'
CJ|0|35|11|0|Here the governor said to Mary, 'See, I am also a great friend of children, but although I am married, nature or God have not blessed me with posterity, so I am given to not seldom adopting strange children - even those of slaves - as my own.
CJ|0|35|12|0|Now I do not intend to say therewith that you should also give me yours, for He is indeed your life.
CJ|0|35|13|0|But I would like to ask you to lay Him upon my arms so I might fondle and caress Him a little!'
CJ|0|35|14|0|Since Mary found the governor to be of such an affectionate nature, she answered, 'Whoever is like you in his heart may indeed take this, my Baby, on his arms!'
CJ|0|35|15|0|Here Mary handed the Baby to the governor to be caressed - and when the governor took the Baby on his arms, such a feeling of joy came over him as he had never before experienced.
CJ|0|35|16|0|And he carried the Baby back and forth in the chamber - and thus also brought Him close to the table bearing the Roman gods.
CJ|0|35|17|0|But this approach immediately cost all the heathen statues their existence, for they melted like wax on red-hot iron.
CJ|0|35|18|0|At this Cyrenius was profoundly shocked and he exclaimed: 'What goes on here? The hard bronze has utterly dissolved, and not even a trace of it remains! You wise man from Palestine, do explain that to me! Are you then a magician?'
CJ|0|36|1|1|Joseph Vindicates Himself Before Cyrenius
CJ|0|36|1|0|JOSEPH WAS greatly surprised at this himself and said to Cyrenius: 'Listen to me, mighty ruler of the land! It cannot be unknown to you that according to the law of my people every sorcerer must be burned.
CJ|0|36|2|0|If accordingly I were a sorcerer, I would not have become as old as I am, for as such I would long ago have fallen into the hands of the high priests in Jerusalem!
CJ|0|36|3|0|Hence the only thing I can tell you here is that this manifestation must surely be connected with the great holiness of this Child.
CJ|0|36|4|0|For even at the birth of this Child signs occurred at which everyone was amazed: the firmament stood open - the winds were hushed - the brooks and rivers stood still - the sun remained standing on the horizon -
CJ|0|36|5|0|the moon did not leave its position, not for about three hours; thus the stars did not move onward either - the animals did not feed nor drink, and everything which normally creeps and stirs sank into a dead rest - I myself was walking and had to remain standing!'
CJ|0|36|6|0|When Cyrenius heard this from Joseph he said to him, 'So this is that remarkable Child, of whom my brother wrote me with the words:
CJ|0|36|7|0|Brother, I must give you the following news - In the neighborhood of Bethlehem a Child has been born to a young woman of the Jewish nation from which emanates a great, wondrous power. I am just about convinced that He is a Child of the gods!
CJ|0|36|8|0|But His father is such a completely honest Jew that I just cannot bring myself to undertake a closer investigation of the matter.
CJ|0|36|9|0|If you should happen to come to Jerusalem in the near future, it might not be uninteresting to you to visit this man in Bethlehem. I keep on thinking that the Child is some sort of masked young Jupiter or at least Apollo. But come, and use your own judgment. -
CJ|0|36|10|0|See, good man, that much of the matter is known to me, but what you have now told me is quite new to me. Therefore tell me whether you are the same man of whom my brother informed me from Bethlehem.'
CJ|0|36|11|0|And Joseph answered, 'Yes, mighty ruler, I am the same! And it is well for your brother that he did not tell you more about the Child!
CJ|0|36|12|0|For he received a word from heaven to be silent about that which took place. Truly, had he told you more, then that would have happened with Rome, which there before your eyes just happened to the images of the gods that stood there on the table!
CJ|0|36|13|0|And great good fortune to you and your brother if you will be silent! For you shall both be blessed for that by the Lord who is the eternally living God, the Creator of heaven and earth!'
CJ|0|36|14|0|These words instilled a great respect of Joseph in Cyrenius and a fear of the Child, so that he promptly laid the Child on Mary's arms again.
CJ|0|36|15|0|After that he again turned to Joseph and said: 'Good, upright man, now listen carefully to what I shall say to you,
CJ|0|36|16|0|for a good thought has just come to my mind, which you shall hear and answer me concerning it!
CJ|0|36|17|0|See, if this Child is of divine descent, then you as His father must also be the same, for ex trunco non fit Mercurius and grapes do not grow on thorns. Neither can a child of the gods be a descendant from an ordinary human being.
CJ|0|36|18|0|Now you as well as your five other sons who are standing behind you appear to be only ordinary human beings to me - yes even the young mother, while, to be sure, a well-mannered Jewess, does not seem to have anything particularly divine about her.
CJ|0|36|19|0|That requires a great, almost unearthly beauty and great wisdom, as we know from the traditional stories about those women with whom at one time the gods are said to have consorted - which to believe requires an indeed great faith that I do not in the least have.
CJ|0|36|20|0|'Besides, I must also call your attention to something else - which is that it was possible for you with your divine Child as one wishing to travel from Bethlehem to Egypt to have gone astray to here, as manifest by your being sad and confused when I pointed out to you that you had gone so far astray on the way to Egypt!
CJ|0|36|21|0|Should your God - or the gods of Rome - really be ignorant of the nearest route from Bethlehem to Egypt?
CJ|0|36|22|0|See, these are sharp contradictions which build up the more one pursues the matter! And on top of that you have even made a threat as to the destruction of Rome if I or my brother were to betray the Child!
CJ|0|36|23|0|Now why should gods threaten the weak mortal, as if they were afraid of him? After all, they need only to openly set foot on the earth, and everyone must blindly obey their mighty will!
CJ|0|36|24|0|So you see, your whole story seems to me to be nothing but a weak deception, intended to mislead me so I might not recognize you for what you really are, either a Jewish magician who sets out for Egypt to make his living with this trade there, since his life is not safe in his homeland -
CJ|0|36|25|0|or perhaps even a crafty Jewish spy, bribed by the power-hungry Herod to detect how the Roman shore-fortifications are set up?
CJ|0|36|26|0|I do of course have the letter of safe-conduct from my brother, and the earlier letter which I mentioned to you - but I still have not discussed this with my brother and therefore these documents could be forged, for my brother's handwriting can also be imitated.
CJ|0|36|27|0|And I now consider you to be both, in other words, a magician and a spy! Now justify yourself in every detail - otherwise you are my prisoner and will not escape a just punishment!'
CJ|0|36|28|0|At these words Joseph looked Cyrenius firmly in the face and asserted: 'Send a fast messenger to your brother Cornelius, have him take both letters with him, and your brother shall bear witness whether matters with me are of such a scandalous nature as you are of the bad opinion!
CJ|0|36|29|0|And such I now insist on from you, for my honor is justified before the eternal God and shall not be crushed underfoot by a pagan! For while you are a patrician of Rome, I am none-the-less a direct descendant of the great king David before whom the circle of the earth trembled, and as such I will not allow myself to be dishonored by a pagan!
CJ|0|36|30|0|And I shall not leave your side now until you have restored my honor to me, for no pagan shall deprive me of the honor which I have received from God!'
CJ|0|36|31|0|These energetic words took Cyrenius aback, for in this manner he as governor, who had command over life and death without restriction, had never heard anyone speak to him. He therefore thought by himself, 'If this man were not conscious of an extraordinary power with him as concerns me, he could not speak like that! Hence I must talk to him now in quite a different manner!"
CJ|0|37|1|1|A Golden Goblet Is Sublimed
CJ|0|37|1|0|AFTER DETERMINING on this, Cyrenius again turned to Joseph and said, 'Good man, you should not hold that against me, for you will surely concede that I as governor do after all have the right to cross-examine someone to find out if he is a friend or enemy of the state!
CJ|0|37|2|0|And that I could not exempt you therefrom - as gladly as I would otherwise have done - for that you need only look at yonder disastrous table which has been freed from its decorations, and it must surely be evident to you that one must look upon people of your kind a bit more sharply than upon those who only drift about as insignificantly as daily flies.
CJ|0|37|3|0|Now I do not feel that I insulted you thereby, but on the contrary only gave you a distinction in that I adjudged you to be that important and spoke to you as becomes me as governor.
CJ|0|37|4|0|You see, I am interested in nothing else than the truth about your background because I judge you to be a truly noteworthy man.
CJ|0|37|5|0|Therefore I purposely raised doubts about you so you should fully assert yourself before me.
CJ|0|37|6|0|Now your manner of speech has shown me that you are a man in whom there is no deceit. I therefore need neither a second message from my brother nor any binding documentary proof from some other source, for I am now convinced that you are a completely honest Jew! - Tell me, is there any need for more than that?'
CJ|0|37|7|0|And Joseph answered, 'Friend, see, I am poor, but you are a mighty ruler! My riches are my loyalty and faith to my God and my complete honesty toward everyone!
CJ|0|37|8|0|But you in addition to representing the emperor are also extremely wealthy in the riches of the world, which I do without. When someone slights your honor you still have the riches of the world to fall back on.
CJ|0|37|9|0|But what is left for me if my honor is taken from me? You can buy honor for yourself with the treasures of the world, but with what shall I buy it?
CJ|0|37|10|0|For that reason the poor man, once he has lost his honor and freedom to a rich man, becomes a slave; but if besides that he has secret riches somewhere, he can again buy honor and freedom.
CJ|0|37|11|0|Now you threatened to make me your prisoner - say, would I then not have lost all my honor and freedom?
CJ|0|37|12|0|And was I then not right in defending myself, since I was after all called to account by you, the governor of Syria and the co-governor of the coast of Tyre and Sidon?'
CJ|0|37|13|0|Here Cyrenius said, 'Good man, I now beg you - let us wholly forget what is past.
CJ|0|37|14|0|See, the sun now stands close to the horizon. My servants have prepared the evening meal in the dining hall, so come with me and refresh yourselves. For I have not had Roman foods, but those of your people prepared, which you are permitted to eat. So follow me without any ill feelings against me, now your friend.'
CJ|0|37|15|0|Hereupon Joseph followed Cyrenius into the dining hall with Mary and the five sons and was greatly amazed at the indescribably rich splendor of the tableware which was mostly wrought of gold, silver and precious stones.
CJ|0|37|16|0|And since the ornate vessels were decorated with all manner of images of pagan gods, Joseph said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|37|17|0|'Friend, I see that all these vessels for your table are decorated with your gods - and you already know the power that emanates from my Child.
CJ|0|37|18|0|See, if I sit at your table with my wife, and my wife with her Child, you will instantly lose all your rich tableware and vessels!
CJ|0|37|19|0|Hence I would advise you to either have vessels set up that are quite plain or common earthenware, or I will not guarantee you your gold and silver.'
CJ|0|37|20|0|When Cyrenius heard this from Joseph, he was startled and at once followed Joseph's advice. The servants promptly brought the foods in dishes of earthenware which were quite smooth and quickly set the gold and silver dishes aside.
CJ|0|37|21|0|But his curiosity nevertheless enticed Cyrenius to bring a magnificent gold goblet near the Child, to ascertain for himself whether the nearness of the Child would really have such a destructive effect on gold as formerly on the bronze images.
CJ|0|37|22|0|And Cyrenius had in fact to pay for his curiosity with the sudden loss of the precious goblet for a time.
CJ|0|37|23|0|When he had thus suffered the loss of the goblet, he took fright and stood there as if he had received an electric shock.
CJ|0|37|24|0|Only after a while did he say, 'Joseph, you great man, you advised me well, and I thank you for it!
CJ|0|37|25|0|But I myself will be accursed if I leave this spot before I find out from you just who this Child is, since He has such power at His disposal!'
CJ|0|37|26|0|Here Joseph turned to Cyrenius and briefly told him the story of the Child's conception and birth.
CJ|0|37|27|0|And Cyrenius, upon hearing Joseph tell this in a firm tone of voice, fell down before the Child and worshiped Him.
CJ|0|37|28|0|And Behold, at that instant the destroyed goblet stood on the floor in front of Cyrenius, but quite smooth and of the same weight. - Hereupon Cyrenius arose and just could not help himself for joy and happiness.
CJ|0|38|1|1|In The Lowliness Of The World
CJ|0|38|1|0|IN THIS happy frame of mind Cyrenius said to Joseph, 'Hear me again, oh great man! If I were now emperor in Rome, I would abdicate the throne and the emperor's crown to you.
CJ|0|38|2|0|And if the emperor Augustus knew about this Child as I do not he would do the same! For while he takes great stock in the fact that he is the mightiest emperor on the earth, so do I also know how highly he places all things divine far above himself.
CJ|0|38|3|0|If you wish, I will write the emperor and guarantee you in advance that he will bring you to Rome amid the greatest honor and will build to the Child, as an unequivocal Son of the most high God, the greatest and most glorious temple
CJ|0|38|4|0|and will exalt Him therein to the skies, and will himself lie in the dust before the Lord whom the elements and all the gods must obey!
CJ|0|38|5|0|And that such is the case with the Child I have now convinced myself for the second time, since not even Jupiter is able to protect himself from Him and no metal can withstand His power!
CJ|0|38|6|0|As I said, if you wish, I will send messengers to Rome still today. Truly, that would cause an incomparable sensation in the great imperial city and would surely humble the proud hierarchy of priests to some extent, who are anyhow at a loss as to how they might further deceive and betray mankind most effectively.'
CJ|0|38|7|0|Hereupon Joseph answered Cyrenius: 'Dear, good friend! Do you really suppose that Rome's veneration means anything to Him whom the sun, the moon and the stars and all the elements of the earth must obey?
CJ|0|38|8|0|Had He so willed that all the world should honor Him like an idol, He would have come down to the earth in all of His infinite eternal divine majesty before the eyes of all the world! But thereby all the world would also have been condemned to its judgment.
CJ|0|38|9|0|Instead He has chosen the lowliness of the world so He might bless the world, as it is written in the book of the prophets; so leave well enough alone as concerns the message to Rome!
CJ|0|38|10|0|'Now if you want to see Rome destroyed then do as you please - for this One is come for the fall of the world of the high and mighty and for the redemption of the lowly - a consolation to the sorrowful and for the resurrection of those who are held in death.
CJ|0|38|11|0|This I firmly believe in my heart. But I have revealed this my faith only to you, otherwise no one shall hear it spoken of by me.
CJ|0|38|12|0|So keep these words as a sacred trust in your heart until that time when a new sun of life will rise for you, and you will be well off.'
CJ|0|38|13|0|These words went like arrows into the heart of Cyrenius and completely changed his attitude to the extent that he would immediately have given up all his authority and assumed a lowly station in life.
CJ|0|38|14|0|But Joseph said to him, 'Friend, friend, remain what you are - for power in the hands of men of your kind is a blessing of God for the people! You see, you are what you are neither from yourself nor from Rome, but only from God! Therefore remain what you are.' - Here Cyrenius praised the unknown God, then sat down at the table in a happy frame of mind and ate and drank with Joseph and Mary.
CJ|0|39|1|1|The Mastery Of Grace Over Death
CJ|0|39|1|0|WHILE THE ROMANS as a rule were used to lengthy feasts, Cyrenius was nevertheless an exception.
CJ|0|39|2|0|When he did not have to arrange such feasts now and then in honor of the emperor, a meal with him was only short, for he was one of those philosophers who say: 'Man does not live to eat, but eats only to live - and that does not require feasts that last for days.'
CJ|0|39|3|0|Thus the hallowed meal was short and was only intended to restore the body.
CJ|0|39|4|0|After the short meal Joseph thanked the Lord for food and drink and blessed the host for it.
CJ|0|39|5|0|Cyrenius, deeply touched at this, admitted to Joseph, 'Oh, how indeed exalted is your religion above mine! How much closer are you to the almighty Deity than I!
CJ|0|39|6|0|And how much more of a human being are you than I can ever be!'
CJ|0|39|7|0|Here Joseph answered Cyrenius, 'Noble friend, you are anxious about that which the Lord has just now bestowed upon you!
CJ|0|39|8|0|But I say to you - Remain what you are, but humble yourself in your heart only before the eternal Lord God and secretly try to do good to all men, and you are as close to God as my fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!
CJ|0|39|9|0|See, in this Child the almighty God has visited you. You have carried Him on your arms! What more do you want? I tell you - you are saved from eternal death and henceforth will neither see, nor feel, nor taste death!'
CJ|0|39|10|0|At this Cyrenius sprang up for joy and exclaimed: 'Oh man - what are you saying? I shall not die?
CJ|0|39|11|0|Oh tell me, how is that possible? See, until now no man has been spared from death! Shall I then really be accepted into the ranks of the eternally living gods, just as I now live?'
CJ|0|39|12|0|And Joseph replied: 'Noble friend, you did not understand me. Now I will tell you what will take place at your earthly end:
CJ|0|39|13|0|Had you died without this grace, then severe illness, pain, sorrow and despair would have put your spirit and your soul to death along with your body, and nothing would have remained for you after this death than a dull, tormenting consciousness of yourself.
CJ|0|39|14|0|In that case you would resemble someone who was half buried to death in his own house which collapsed on him and who was therefore buried alive and must feel and taste death in this manner in bitter despair, since he is totally unable to help himself.
CJ|0|39|15|0|But if you die in this grace of God, then only this heavy body will be taken from you, and you will awaken to an eternal, most perfect life in which you will no more ask - Where is my earthly body?
CJ|0|39|16|0|And once the Lord of life calls you, you will be able to put your body aside yourself like an old, burdensome garment when you have received your spiritual freedom!'
CJ|0|39|17|0|These words made a most profound impression on Cyrenius. He therefore fell down before the Child and entreated Him, 'O Lord of the heavens, so then retain me in such grace!' And the Baby smiled at him and lifted a little hand over him.
CJ|0|40|1|1|Mary's Wisdom Astonishes Cyrenius
CJ|0|40|1|0|AFTER THAT Cyrenius arose and said to Mary, 'Oh happiest of all women and all mothers on the earth! Tell me, how does your heart feel, since you surely have the fullest conviction within yourself that heaven and earth here rests upon your arms!'
CJ|0|40|2|0|And Mary replied: 'Friend, how can you ask me what your own heart tells you?
CJ|0|40|3|0|See, we walk the same earth which God created by His will, we constantly tread on His wonders with our feet - and still there are millions upon millions of people who would rather bend their knees before the works of their hands than before the eternally true and living God!
CJ|0|40|4|0|Now if the great works of God are unable to awaken the children of men, how then shall a Child in diapers bring that to pass?
CJ|0|40|5|0|'For that reason it will be given to only a few to recognize the Lord in the Child! Only to those who like you are of good will!
CJ|0|40|6|0|And those who are of good will do not need to come to me, so I might tell them how I feel in my heart.
CJ|0|40|7|0|The Child will reveal Himself in their hearts and will bless them and will let them feel like the mother feels who carries the Child on her arms!
CJ|0|40|8|0|I am very happy, yes immeasurably happy that I carry this Child on my arms -
CJ|0|40|9|0|but in the future all those who carry Him only in their hearts will be greater and happier still!
CJ|0|40|10|0|Do you also carry Him imperishably in your heart, and you will receive that of which my husband Joseph has assured you!'
CJ|0|40|11|0|When Cyrenius heard these words from the lovely Mary, he was greatly astonished at her wisdom.
CJ|0|40|12|0|He therefore said to Joseph, 'Listen, you most fortunate of men on the earth! Who would ever have looked for such truly deep wisdom in your young wife?
CJ|0|40|13|0|Truly, if there really were a Minerva, she would have to hide herself in the depths of the earth from this most captivating mother!'
CJ|0|40|14|0|And Joseph replied, 'See, every human being can be wise in its way from God, but without Him there is no wisdom on the earth.
CJ|0|40|15|0|This also explains the wisdom of my wife.
CJ|0|40|16|0|And since the Lord in times past has already spoken to men by the mouth of animals, why should He not do so through men?
CJ|0|40|17|0|But let us leave that be now, for I believe it is time to plan for the departure tomorrow!'
CJ|0|40|18|0|Here Cyrenius said, 'Joseph, do not worry about that, for everything has long been attended to, and tomorrow I will accompany you to Ostracine myself!'
CJ|0|41|1|1|The Voyage To Egypt
CJ|0|41|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH said to Cyrenius: 'Noble friend, your intention is worthy and good, but you will hardly be able to carry it out.
CJ|0|41|2|0|See, this very night letters will arrive for you from Herod in which you will be requested to seize all male children along the sea coast in their first and second years and to send them to Bethlehem so Herod  may  kill  them there!
CJ|0|41|3|0|Now you are of course able to oppose Herod, but your poor brother will unfortunately have to go along with this evil business so he will not expose himself to the bite of this most venomous of all serpents.
CJ|0|41|4|0|Believe me, while I am now with you, murder stalks in Bethlehem and a hundred mothers are rending their garments in despair because of the cruel loss of their children.
CJ|0|41|5|0|'And all that is taking place because of one Child, of which the three wise men from Persia declared in the spiritual sense that He would be a king of the Jews.
CJ|0|41|6|0|But Herod understood a worldly king thereby, and that is why he wants to kill Him, since he wants to bring the scepter of Judea on his posterity and fears that this One might wrest it from him - when actually this Child only came into the world to redeem mankind from eternal death!'
CJ|0|41|7|0|When Cyrenius heard this, he sprang up in fury against Herod and announced to Joseph,
CJ|0|41|8|0|'Listen to me, oh man of God! This monster shall not make use of me as his tool! This day I shall depart with you, and you will find a good night's lodging in my own thirty-oared ship!
CJ|0|41|9|0|In the meantime I shall instruct my most trusted and by all the gods sworn officials what they are to do with all messengers who arrive here with dispatches for me.
CJ|0|41|10|0|See, according to our secret laws they must be detained until I return.
CJ|0|41|11|0|The letters will be taken from them and must be sent after me unbeknownst to the messengers of Herod, so I may know what is in them.
CJ|0|41|12|0|Now I already know what the contents of these letters are certain to be, and I also know for how long I shall be gone. Should other messengers follow, the detention tower will hold them also until I return.
CJ|0|41|13|0|So then have your family get ready for the journey, and we will promptly board my seaworthy ship!'
CJ|0|41|14|0|Joseph was satisfied therewith, and in one hour all were comfortably lodged on board ship, wherein Joseph's pack animals were also well accommodated. A northwind blew, and the voyage progressed smoothly.
CJ|0|41|15|0|The voyage lasted seven days, and all of the ship's company made assurances that never before had they rowed through these waters without the least hindrance -
CJ|0|41|16|0|which they felt was all the more remarkable this time since - as they said according to their belief - Neptune was dealing with his element in a remarkable way, for he was putting his creations in the depths of the sea in order and was holding a council with his attendants.
CJ|0|41|17|0|Here Cyrenius said to the wondering ship's crew, 'Listen, there are two kinds of ignorance - one is of one's own free will, the other is imposed.
CJ|0|41|18|0|If yours were freely held, then it would be possible to help you; but you are held in the one that is imposed and sanctioned by law, and there one cannot help you;
CJ|0|41|19|0|so you may as well hold to the idea that Neptune has lost his triad and does not trust himself to chastise us now with his scaly hand for the sacrilege of sailing across his domain.'
CJ|0|41|20|0|Hereupon Joseph asked Cyrenius, is it not customary to reward the ship's company? Tell me, and I will do what is fitting so they shall not speak ill of us.'
CJ|0|41|21|0|At this Cyrenius said, 'do not worry about that. See, they are under my command and have their pay for their service - so you need not be concerned there.'
CJ|0|41|22|0|Joseph answered, 'That is of course true - but they are also human beings like we are, so we should deal with them as such.
CJ|0|41|23|0|Insofar as their ignorance is sanctioned by law, let them dedicate their outer self to it, but my gift shall make their spirit free!
CJ|0|41|24|0|So let them come over here that I may bless them and they may begin to realize in their hearts that the sun of grace and salvation has risen for them also!'
CJ|0|41|25|0|Here Cyrenius called the ship's company together and Joseph spoke the following words over them:
CJ|0|41|26|0|'Hear me, oh faithful servants of Rome and this your master! You have guided the ship faithfully and diligently, and you shall have a good reward from me, who benefited from this voyage.
CJ|0|41|27|0|Now I am poor and have neither gold nor silver - but I have the grace of God in rich measure, which is the grace of that God whom you call: the Unknown!
CJ|0|41|28|0|May the great God pour this grace into your breast, so your spirit may be awakened!'
CJ|0|41|29|0|At these words all of them experienced a feeling of infinite joy and began to honor and praise the unknown God.
CJ|0|41|30|0|And Cyrenius marveled at this effect of Joseph's blessing and then had himself blessed by him also.
CJ|0|42|1|1|The Arrival In Ostracine
CJ|0|42|1|0|CYRENIUS ALSO EXPERIENCED such a feeling of great joy that he affirmed, 'Man in my greatest esteem - I now feel just as I did when I held the Baby in my arms!
CJ|0|42|2|0|Are you then of the same nature with Him? Or how is it that I now feel the same blessing?'
CJ|0|42|3|0|And Joseph replied, 'Noble friend, such power does not come from me, but only from the Lord of heaven and earth!
CJ|0|42|4|0|It only streams through me on such an occasion, that it might thereupon flow over to you with its blessing - but I myself will never have such power, for God alone is all in all.
CJ|0|42|5|0|Therefore honor this one and only true God constantly in your heart, and the fullness of this His blessing will never depart from you!'
CJ|0|42|6|0|Joseph continued, 'And now, friend, look, we have reached this shore with the almighty help of the Lord, but it seems to me that we are still a long way from Ostracine.
CJ|0|42|7|0|In which direction does it lie, so we might go there? See, the day is waning. What are we going to do? Will we go on or remain here until tomorrow?'
CJ|0|42|8|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'See, we are at the entrance to the great bay, in whose innermost angle on our right lies Ostracine as a rich city of commerce.
CJ|0|42|9|0|If we go ashore here we can easily reach it in three hours - but if we arrive there at night we will have difficulty in finding a lodging. So I suggest that we spend the night here on board and go there tomorrow.'
CJ|0|42|10|0|But Joseph said, 'Oh friend, if it is only three hours away then there is no reason for spending the night here. It is well for your ship to remain here, so you will attract no attention in this city - but I shall secretly go to my destination.
CJ|0|42|11|0|For if the Roman garrison there were to discover the ship of a governor from Rome, they would have to receive you with great honors,
CJ|0|42|12|0|and then I as your friend would have to share your honors with you whether I wanted to or not, which would certainly be most inopportune for me.
CJ|0|42|13|0|I am therefore quite anxious to continue the journey right away. See, my pack animals are now well rested and can very easily take us to Ostracine in a short time.
CJ|0|42|14|0|My sons are strong and nimble afoot; they can walk, and you with your needed servants can use these five pack animals and we can easily travel the road to the not-far city.'
CJ|0|42|15|0|Cyrenius accepted Joseph's advice and turned the ship over to the faithful care of the ship's company, then took along four servants, whereupon 'they mounted Joseph's pack animals and promptly traveled with Joseph to the city,
CJ|0|42|16|0|which was reached in two hours. As they entered the city, the guard at the gate requested letters of safe-conduct.
CJ|0|42|17|0|Cyrenius then revealed his identity to the captain of the guard who immediately had the soldiers salute him and then made arrangements for lodging.
CJ|0|42|18|0|Thus the party of travelers was received in this city without the least delay and was lodged in the best possible quarters.
CJ|0|43|1|1|Cyrenius Buys A Villa
CJ|0|43|1|0|ON THE MORNING of the following day Cyrenius promptly sent a messenger to the commander of the military garrison and invited him to come to him as soon as he reasonably could, but without any ceremony.
CJ|0|43|2|0|And the commander came to Cyrenius and said, 'Exalted vice-regent of the great emperor in Coelo-Syria and supreme commander of Tyre and Sidon, I await your wishes!'
CJ|0|43|3|0|Cyrenius replied, 'Most esteemed commander! In the first place I desire that no marks of honor be accorded me this time, for I am here incognito.
CJ|0|43|4|0|Secondly I would like to find out from you whether it is possible to buy or at least rent an unpretentious dwelling here, either in the city itself or some villa not too far from the city.
CJ|0|43|5|0|For I would like to buy something like that for a very highly esteemed and most honorable Jewish family.
CJ|0|43|6|0|This family has been forced to flee Palestine for reasons well known to us, pursued by that rare Herod, and now seeks protection under our Roman tolerance and constantly firm justice.
CJ|0|43|7|0|I have closely investigated the background of this family and found it to be just and without blemish - but that as such it cannot hold out under Herod is just as understandable as it is understandable that this abominable creature of a tetrarch of Palestine and a part of Judea is Rome's greatest enemy.
CJ|0|43|8|0|I believe you understand just what I mean by that. I therefore would like to buy a small and useful piece of property here for his said family.
CJ|0|43|9|0|If you know of anything like that, do me the favor and let me know. You see, I cannot remain here very long this time, for important matters await me in Tyre, so everything must be arranged still today.'
CJ|0|43|10|0|Here the commander said to Cyrenius, 'Most illustrious ruler! Then the matter is soon taken care of - for I have built a nice little villa for myself about half a mile outside of the city and there developed orchards and three fine acres of corn.
CJ|0|43|11|0|But I just have too little time to properly take care of it. It is wholly my own, so if you want it, I will sell it with everything that goes with it for a hundred pounds, and it can be owned without payment of taxes.'
CJ|0|43|12|0|When Cyrenius heard this he gave his hand to the commander, then had his servant bring his purse and immediately paid the commander in ready money for the villa sight unseen and then, unseen by Joseph, had the commander take him there so he might inspect his purchase.
CJ|0|43|13|0|When he had looked over the to him very pleasing villa, he told his servants to remain in the villa until he returned with the family.
CJ|0|43|14|0|Thereupon he went to the city with the commander, had him draw up the parchment scroll signifying property ownership, took his leave from the commander and then joyfully went to see Joseph.
CJ|0|43|15|0|The latter at once said to him, 'Dear, good friend, I must thank my God for His blessings upon you which have enabled you to bestow so much friendship on me!
CJ|0|43|16|0|I am now saved and had a wonderful lodging here last night. But I must remain in this land - what will the future bring? Where will I live, how make my living? See, I must look to that right away.'
CJ|0|43|17|0|Cyrenius answered, 'Quite so, my greatly esteemed man and friend! Therefore have your family pack up your belongings and come with me bag and baggage, and we will look for something a few hundred steps outside of the city, since I have learned that nothing is available in the city.' - This was quite agreeable to Joseph and he did as Cyrenius wished.
CJ|0|44|1|1|The Family's New Home
CJ|0|44|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS reached the purchased villa with Joseph and his family, Joseph said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|44|2|0|'Noble friend! There I would be happy - an unpretentious villa, a comely orchard full of dates, figs, pomegranates, oranges, apples, pears and cherries,
CJ|0|44|3|0|grapes, almonds, melons and a mass of vegetables. And next to it a pasture and three acres of corn - all that surely belongs to this!
CJ|0|44|4|0|Truly, I want nothing pretentious or ornate, but this practically laid-out villa, which has great similarity with my leased farmstead at Nazareth in Judea, I would like to either rent or buy.'
CJ|0|44|5|0|Here Cyrenius drew out the ownership scroll and handed it to Joseph with the words,
CJ|0|44|6|0|'May the Lord, your and now also my God, bless it for you! I herewith hand over to you the tax-free, complete ownership of this villa.
CJ|0|44|7|0|Everything that you see enclosed by a thick hedge and held in with a palisade fence belongs to this villa! In back of the dwelling there is also a roomy stable for donkeys and cows, where you will find two cows and space for your pack animals, of which you already have enough for your needs.
CJ|0|44|8|0|But if in time you should wish to return to the land of your fathers, you can then sell this property and with the money buy yourself some property there.
CJ|0|44|9|0|In short - you, my great friend, are now in full ownership of this villa and can do with it what you will.
CJ|0|44|10|0|I am going to remain here for today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow so Herod's messengers of ill tidings shall impatiently await me all the longer
CJ|0|44|11|0|For this short time only I will also make use of this villa because of my great love for you.
CJ|0|44|12|0|I would of course only need to give the order, and the imperial palace would have to be made ready for me at once - in the first place because I hold the emperor's full power of authority,
CJ|0|44|13|0|and also because I am a close relative of the emperor.
CJ|0|44|14|0|But all this I set aside because of my great respect and love for you, and quite especially for the Child whom I unquestionably consider to be at least the Son of the most high God!'
CJ|0|44|15|0|Joseph was so deeply moved at this noble surprise that in his heartfelt joy he could only weep, but not smile.
CJ|0|44|16|0|And Mary also fared no better, but she quickly regained her self-control, went over to Cyrenius and expressed her gratitude by laying the Baby in Cyrenius' arms. And Cyrenius, deeply touched, asserted, 'O my great Lord and God! Is a sinner really worthy of holding You on his hands? So then be gracious and merciful to me!'
CJ|0|45|1|1|A Comparison With Israel In Egypt
CJ|0|45|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH recovered from his great surprise, he inspected everything with Cyrenius.
CJ|0|45|2|0|Mary, who again took the Baby from the arms of Cyrenius, also looked at everything and was full of joy at the great kindness of the Lord, since He had also provided so well for her in an earthly way.
CJ|0|45|3|0|When they had seen everything and entered the well-kept dwelling, Mary blissfully said to Joseph,
CJ|0|45|4|0|'Oh my dear, beloved Joseph! See, I am overjoyed that the Lord has provided for us so well!
CJ|0|45|5|0|Yes, on the whole it seems to me as if the Lord had turned the whole old order around.
CJ|0|45|6|0|Just look, once He led the children of Israel from Egypt into the Promised Land of Palestine, in that day called Canaan,
CJ|0|45|7|0|but now He has again made Egypt into the promised land and fled with us or rather led us here Himself from where He once redeemingly led our fathers through the desert into the Promised Land, which overflowed with milk and honey.'
CJ|0|45|8|0|Joseph replied, 'Mary, there is much to be said for your glad comment,
CJ|0|45|9|0|but I believe that your statement applies only to our present situation.
CJ|0|45|10|0|On the whole it seems to me as if the Lord had now done with us what he once did with the sons of Jacob when the great famine had just broken out in the land of Canaan.
CJ|0|45|11|0|The people of Israel then stayed in Egypt until Moses came, but Moses led them home again through the desert.
CJ|0|45|12|0|And I believe It will also be the same with us - we too will not be buried here and will surely have to return to Canaan when the time is right.
CJ|0|45|13|0|To guide our fathers homeward, a Moses did indeed have to be first raised up, but now we already have the Moses of Moseses in our midst!
CJ|0|45|14|0|Therefore I believe it will come to pass as I have spoken!
CJ|0|45|15|0|Mary kept all these words in her heart and agreed with Joseph.
CJ|0|45|16|0|And Cyrenius also listened to this conversation very closely and then asked Joseph to tell him about the early history of the Jews.
CJ|0|46|1|1|Joseph Acquaints Cyrenius With Jewish History
CJ|0|46|1|0|JOSEPH NOW TOLD his sons to provide for the animals and to see what foodstuffs were available.
CJ|0|46|2|0|The sons did everything according to Joseph's will, provided for the animals, milked the cows,
CJ|0|46|3|0|then went into the storeroom and there found a large supply of flour, bread, fruits and also several pots full of honey.
CJ|0|46|4|0|For the commander of the garrison was an expert beekeeper according to the traditional school in Rome which was eulogized by a Roman poet of that day.
CJ|0|46|5|0|The sons then brought bread, milk, butter and honey into the living room to Joseph
CJ|0|46|6|0|who thereupon looked everything over, thanked God, blessed all the foods and then had them put on the table and asked Cyrenius to partake of them.
CJ|0|46|7|0|The latter gladly accepted Joseph's invitation, for he too delighted in milk and honey-bread.
CJ|0|46|8|0|During the meal Joseph briefly told Cyrenius the history of the Jews along with the story of creation and of the human race
CJ|0|46|9|0|and presented it all in such a concise and orderly manner as to quite convince Cyrenius that Joseph had spoken the most reliable truth.
CJ|0|46|10|0|But while this made him very happy for his part, he was saddened for his own in Rome, whom he well knew to be in gross darkness.
CJ|0|46|11|0|He accordingly said to Joseph, 'Venerable man and now the greatest friend of my life!
CJ|0|46|12|0|See, I have now conceived a plan. I shall report everything I have now heard from you to my almost own brother, the emperor Augustus, but only as if I had accidentally heard it from a Jew otherwise wholly unknown to me.
CJ|0|46|13|0|Your name and dwelling place will not be mentioned in the least - for why should the best man in Rome, the emperor Augustus, my brother, have to die forever?'
CJ|0|46|14|0|This time Joseph agreed, and Cyrenius remained in Ostracine where he completed a scroll in three days and sent it to the emperor in Rome by a special ship with the sole signature: Your brother Cyrenius. -
CJ|0|46|15|0|A careful perusal of this message from Cyrenius opened the emperor's eyes - whereupon he began to respect the Jews and even gave them an opportunity to be accepted as full Roman citizens for a small tax.
CJ|0|46|16|0|At the same time all especially artful preachers of paganism were banned from Rome under one pretext or another.
CJ|0|46|17|0|The usually so beloved poet Ovid was banned from Rome for a similar reason which was not made publicly known, and thereafter the hierarchy of priests did not fare too well under Augustus.
CJ|0|47|1|1|The First Letter Of Cyrenius To Herod
CJ|0|47|1|0|ON THE FOURTH DAY Cyrenius took his leave after especially enjoining the garrison commander to unfailingly make his protection available to this family at every opportunity.
CJ|0|47|2|0|And when he was leaving, Joseph with his entire family wanted to accompany him to where his ship was anchored.
CJ|0|47|3|0|This Cyrenius declined in a very friendly manner and said, 'My very dear, venerable friend, save yourself the trouble and stay here.
CJ|0|47|4|0|For one cannot know how many later messengers may already have caught up with my ship - and with what manner of reports.
CJ|0|47|5|0|And while your safety is now assured, it is also necessary for me to use such prudence here that no spying probers shall find out for what reason I now visited Egypt in January.'
CJ|0|47|6|0|Joseph well understood Cyrenius, remained at home and blessed his benefactor in the entrance hall of the house.
CJ|0|47|7|0|Thereupon Cyrenius, after promising to visit Joseph again soon, departed on foot with his four servants and in a short time reached his ship.
CJ|0|47|8|0|Arrived there, he was immediately received with great rejoicing - but after this several news-bearers came to him with great lamentations.
CJ|0|47|9|0|For many parents fled the coast of Palestine from the persecution of Herod, the child-murderer, and in great agitation told Cyrenius of the abominations Herod was committing around Bethlehem and in the whole southern part of Palestine with the help of the Roman soldiers.
CJ|0|47|10|0|At this Cyrenius immediately wrote a letter to the prefect of Jerusalem, and another of the same import to Herod himself.
CJ|0|47|11|0|And the letter read briefly as follows: i Cyrenius, a brother of the emperor and supreme governor of Asia and Egypt, command you in the name of the emperor to desist from your cruelty on the spot,
CJ|0|47|12|0|failing which I shall look upon Herod as a naked rebel and shall discipline him according to the law, according to decency and according to my just anger.
CJ|0|47|13|0|His abominations are to be closely investigated by the prefect of Jerusalem who is to unfailingly inform me thereof, so the ruthless tyrant shall not escape a just punishment for his deed.
CJ|0|47|14|0|Written on my ship "Augustus" off the coast of Ostracine, in the name of the emperor, by his supreme representative in Asia and Egypt and particularly governor of Coelesyria, Tyre and Sidon. Cyrenius vice Augusti.'
CJ|0|48|1|1|The Second Letter Of Cyrenius To Herod
CJ|0|48|1|0|THE PREFECT of Jerusalem and Herod were greatly terrified at the letter from Cyrenius, ceased their abominations and sent messengers to Tyre, who were to acquaint Cyrenius with the important reason why they were acting thus.
CJ|0|48|2|0|They described in lurid colors the legation of the anyhow slippery Persians and even claimed that they had discovered important secret leads which showed that none other than Cornelius, the brother of Cyrenius, had a part in this secret, typically Asian intrigue.
CJ|0|48|3|0|For it had been ascertained that Cornelius had taken this new king of the Jews under his protection,
CJ|0|48|4|0|and that Herod now had in mind to send messengers to Rome because of this if Cyrenius were not to grant him security.
CJ|0|48|5|0|Therefore Cyrenius was to subject Cornelius to the strictest examination - failing which the report would unfailingly be dispatched to the emperor.
CJ|0|48|6|0|This reprisal, which Cyrenius received when he had already returned to Tyre, at first made him hesitate.
CJ|0|48|7|0|But he quickly got hold of himself, led by the Spirit of God, and wrote the following lines to Herod:
CJ|0|48|8|0|'How does the secret law of Augustus read in regard to the discovery of a possible intrigue? It reads thus: If anyone discovers any manner of secret intrigue, he is to conduct himself very calmly and shall immediately and in all detail report everything to the highest state authority.
CJ|0|48|9|0|Neither a separate governor and still less a perfect shall lay hold of the sword without an explicit order from the highest state authority which first must well investigate the whole matter.
CJ|0|48|10|0|For nowhere can an untimely attack effect greater damage against the state than in just this point,
CJ|0|48|11|0|since the conspiracy in that case retreats and hides its intrigue with still more artful cunning and effectively comes into the open with it under more favorable circumstances when it can be certain of attaining its end.
CJ|0|48|12|0|'This is the most wise emperor's law from his own mouth in this ever so important consideration.
CJ|0|48|13|0|Did you act in accordance with it? - My brother Cornelius acted in accordance with it! He quickly took possession of the supposed new king of the Jews,
CJ|0|48|14|0|then delivered him into my hands, and I have long given orders for his most just disposal according to the power vested in me over Asia and Egypt.
CJ|0|48|15|0|My brother made representations to you regarding all that - but he spoke to deaf ears.
CJ|0|48|16|0|As actual rebels you have undertaken the murder of the children against all representations of my brother and on top of that have impudently called upon me to support you! Is that what you call administering the imperial law?
CJ|0|48|17|0|'I now tell you: the emperor has already been informed of the whole matter and has empowered me to depose the prefect of Jerusalem, although he is related to me, and to impose on Herod a fine of ten thousand pounds in gold.
CJ|0|48|18|0|The deposed prefect is to appear before me within five days and Herod is to settle his fine here in at most thirty days in full, failing which his right of tenure will be declared forfeit. Fiat! Cyrenius, vice Augusti.'
CJ|0|49|1|1|The Great Confrontation
CJ|0|49|1|0|THIS LETTER of Cyrenius finally aroused the utmost alarm in the prefect of Jerusalem as well as in Herod.
CJ|0|49|2|0|Herod and the prefect, named Maronius Pilla, therefore hastily made their way to Cyrenius -
CJ|0|49|3|0|Herod, to bargain down some of his penance, and the prefect, to again be admitted to his office.
CJ|0|49|4|0|When they arrived in Tyre with many attendants, the populace became terrified - for it was of the opinion that Herod would also carry out his terror here with the agreement of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|49|5|0|Therefore they ran breathlessly toward him, prostrated themselves and begged and screamed for mercy and pity!
CJ|0|49|6|0|Cyrenius, who did not know what caused this consternation among the people, was at first shocked,
CJ|0|49|7|0|but then collected himself and sympathetically asked the people what had taken place that caused them to cry out before him in such great fear.
CJ|0|49|8|0|And the people cried: 'He is here, he is here, the monster of monsters who had many thousands of most innocent children murdered in all of Palestine!'
CJ|0|49|9|0|At this Cyrenius understood the reason for the people's fear and reassured them, whereupon the people lost their fear and went their way while he prepared himself to receive the pair.
CJ|0|49|10|0|The people had barely dispersed, when both already asked to be admitted.
CJ|0|49|11|0|Herod was the first to step before Cyrenius, bowed deeply before the imperial eminence, and asked for permission to speak.
CJ|0|49|12|0|And Cyrenius, in great excitement, loudly demanded: 'Speak, you for whom hell is too good to give you a name! Speak, most evil outcast from the lowest hell! What do you want from me?'
CJ|0|49|13|0|And Herod, fully paling before the stentorian voice of Cyrenius, quakingly spoke: 'Lord of the glory of Rome! Too unattainably high is the penance dictated by you - abate me therefore the half of it!
CJ|0|49|14|0|For let Zeus be my witness that I undertook what I did in just fervor for Rome!
CJ|0|49|15|0|I have, I admit, acted cruelly; but it could not have been done otherwise, for the glittering Persian delegation obviously gave me cause to act that way, since it deceived me contrary to its promise!'
CJ|0|49|16|0|But Cyrenius thundered: 'Get thee behind me, wicked liar to your own advantage! I know the whole story! Acknowledge the dictated penance at once, or I will have your head struck from your body on this very spot!'
CJ|0|49|17|0|At this Herod acknowledged the penance, .and that under the threat of losing the right to his letter of tenure, which was demanded of him and was only restored after the penance was met.
CJ|0|49|18|0|Cyrenius then ordered him to depart and received Maronius Pilla.
CJ|0|49|19|0|But the latter, since he had heard the voice of Cyrenius from the antechamber, came before him more dead than alive.
CJ|0|49|20|0|But Cyrenius said to him, 'Pilla, get hold of yourself; for you were forced to act as you did. You must give me important clarifications - that is why I sent for you. No penance awaits you except that of your heart before God!'
CJ|0|50|1|1|The Prefect Of Jerusalem's Complicity
CJ|0|50|1|0|AFTER BEING THUS addressed by Cyrenius, Maronius Pilla felt as if a stone had been lifted from his chest, his pulse began to beat more freely and he was soon able to answer Cyrenius.
CJ|0|50|2|0|When Cyrenius saw that Maronius Pilla had recovered, he asked him as follows:
CJ|0|50|3|0|'I tell you, give me the most conscientious answer to what I am going to ask you!
CJ|0|50|4|0|Tell me, do you know whose first-born Child is supposed to be the so-called new King of the Jews?'
CJ|0|50|5|0|Maronius Pilla answered, 'Yes, I know them personally according to the declaration of the Jewish priests! The father is named Joseph and is a carpenter of the best reputation in all of Judea and half of Palestine and resides close to Nazareth.
CJ|0|50|6|0|His honesty is known in the whole country as well as in all of Jerusalem. About eleven months ago he had to take a matured girl out of the Jewish temple into his care, by some manner of casting lots, I believe.
CJ|0|50|7|0|In the absence of this upright carpenter this girl probably paid homage to Venus a bit too early, became pregnant, for which reason according to my knowledge this man then had to withstand serious difficulties with the Jewish priesthood.
CJ|0|50|8|0|To that extent the matter is well known to me, but as concerns the giving birth by this girl - whom this man, to avoid the disgrace which he had to fear from his compatriots, is supposed to have taken to wife before she gave birth - extremely mystical tales have spread among the people, and one just does not know what one should believe.
CJ|0|50|9|0|On the occasion of the census-taking she delivered in Bethlehem, and that in a stable - this much I have ascertained.
CJ|0|50|10|0|Anything more than that is wholly unknown to me, and such I also told Herod.
CJ|0|50|11|0|But he was of the opinion that Cornelius wanted to hide the family of which the Persians made him suspicious somewhere among the people, so he might contest his right to the tenure of the throne, since Herod well knows that your brother is not his friend.
CJ|0|50|12|0|That is also why he took his refuge in this abnormal cruelty, so he primarily might thwart the plan of Cornelius rather than to actually seize this new King.
CJ|0|50|13|0|He therefore committed this infanticidal vengeance more to revenge himself on your brother than from fear of this new King. That is all I can tell you of this strange occurrence.'
CJ|0|50|14|0|And Cyrenius stated: 'Up to now I have realized from your words that you did indeed speak the truth, but I in no way failed to see that you in effect wanted to whitewash Herod before me.
CJ|0|50|15|0|Now I tell you: Herod's act, as I have written, is in no way excusable.
CJ|0|50|16|0|For I will tell you why Herod perpetrated this most inhuman cruelty.
CJ|0|50|17|0|Listen! Herod is himself the most tyrannical human being whom the earth ever nurtured.
CJ|0|50|18|0|If he could do it and to some extent had the power, he would even today do that with us Romans, Augustus not excepted, what he did with the most innocent children! Do you understand me?
CJ|0|50|19|0|He undertook this infanticide only because he was of the opinion that by doing us Romans a great, estimable service and by thus showing himself to be a genuine Roman patriot, the emperor would also bestow my office upon him in addition to his tetrarchy,
CJ|0|50|20|0|with which, as representative of the emperor just as I am, he could then make unrestricted use of one-third of the entire Roman might and thus also make himself wholly free and independent of Rome, so that he might hold sway as the only sovereign over Asia and Egypt.
CJ|0|50|21|0|Do you follow me? - See, that is the to me well-known plan of this old monster; and as I know him, so also does Augustus now know him.
CJ|0|50|22|0|And now I ask you with your head as forfeit of the truth, which you are to tell me as to whether you knew about this plan of Herod when he made you his most despicable instrument.
CJ|0|50|23|0|Speak, but remember that every untrue, evasive syllable will cost you your life! For I know every point in this matter in minute detail.'
CJ|0|50|24|0|Here Maronius Pilla again turned into a corpse and stuttered, 'Yes, you are right, I also knew what Herod had in mind.
CJ|0|50|25|0|But I feared his arch spirit of intrigue and therefore had to do his bidding, that by doing so the basis for a still greater intrigue might be destroyed for him.
CJ|0|50|26|0|But I did not know Herod as completely through and through as I now know him through you; for if I had, he would not be alive today!'
CJ|0|50|27|0|'Good,' responded Cyrenius, 'I am sparing your life in the name of the emperor - but I shall not restore you to your office until your soul recovers from a great illness! You will be cared for here at my side, and your duties will be looked after for the time being by my brother Cornelius, for I just do not trust you. So you will remain here until you get well.'
CJ|0|51|1|1|A Promise For Maronius Pilla
CJ|0|51|1|0|WHEN MARONIUS PILLA received this verdict from Cyrenius, he declared in a quaking voice,
CJ|0|51|2|0|'Woe is me, all is betrayed! I am a republican, and such has been openly set forth to the emperor. Woe, I am lost!'
CJ|0|51|3|0|And Cyrenius asserted, 'I well knew what purposes you both served and what motive allied you with Herod in the murder of the children.
CJ|0|51|4|0|That is also why I acted as I did.
CJ|0|51|5|0|Truly, if you, like me, were not descended from the first house in Rome, I would without any mercy have had your head struck off,
CJ|0|51|6|0|if I did not even have you fastened to a cross! But I pardoned you, in the first place because you were more misled by Herod to take this step, and because you are one of the first patricians of Rome along with me and Augustus Caesar.
CJ|0|51|7|0|But you will not be prefect as long as Herod lives and until you are completely healed.
CJ|0|51|8|0|And you will fulfill the condition of your being here in that you will take upon you without any argument the work which I shall apportion to you, and that you shall lead your life under my strict observation.
CJ|0|51|9|0|'In the spring I am going to make an official trip to Egypt - to where you will accompany me.
CJ|0|51|10|0|There a wise old man lives outside the city. I will let him examine you - and he will tell you all your illness.
CJ|0|51|11|0|There the first moment will show to what extent all your statements are to be trusted.
CJ|0|51|12|0|So prepare yourself well, for there you will encounter more than the oracle at Delphi.
CJ|0|51|13|0|There you will be confronted by a judge whose keenness of eye makes bronze melt like wax. - So be prepared, for this declaration will stand!'
CJ|0|52|1|1|The Baby Speaks His First Words
CJ|0|52|1|0|THAT CERTAIN SPRING soon arrived, for in this region spring begins in the middle of February.
CJ|0|52|2|0|But Cyrenius decided to leave for Egypt only by the middle of March, which month was usually chosen by the Romans for dealing with military matters.
CJ|0|52|3|0|When the middle of March arrived, Cyrenius quickly had his ship made ready and embarked on the journey to Egypt with Maronius Pilla promptly on the fifteenth of the month.
CJ|0|52|4|0|This time the voyage was made in five days.
CJ|0|52|5|0|On this occasion Cyrenius allowed himself to be received with all honors in Ostracine, since he had to undertake extended military inspections and visits this time,
CJ|0|52|6|0|which required that he be received with full ceremony.
CJ|0|52|7|0|Consequently his arrival caused an unusually great sensation in Ostracine, word of which soon reached the villa.
CJ|0|52|8|0|Joseph therefore sent his two oldest sons into the city to carefully inquire what it was that brought the whole city into such activity.
CJ|0|52|9|0|The two sons hurried away and soon returned with the good news that Cyrenius had arrived in the city, and where he resided.
CJ|0|52|10|0|When Joseph heard this, he said to Mary, 'Listen, we must promptly visit this great benefactor, and the Baby must be taken along also!'
CJ|0|52|11|0|And Mary, full of joy at this news, declared, 'Oh dear Joseph, that is taken for granted, for the Baby is after all the special darling of Cyrenius!'
CJ|0|52|12|0|Hereupon Mary promptly dressed the by now considerably grown Child in completely new clothes which she had made herself and thus in her motherly love and innocence asked the Baby,
CJ|0|52|13|0|'Well, my darling little Son, my beloved Jesus, are You also coming along to visit the dear Cyrenius?'
CJ|0|52|14|0|And the Baby smiled at Mary ever so cheerfully and clearly spoke the first word, and the word was:
CJ|0|52|15|0|'Mary, now I follow you, until one day you will follow Me!'
CJ|0|52|16|0|These words brought about such an exalted frame of mind in Joseph's house that Joseph almost forgot he planned to visit Cyrenius.
CJ|0|52|17|0|But the Baby Himself admonished Joseph not to postpone his intended visit, saying that Cyrenius this time had much to do for the people's welfare.
CJ|0|53|1|1|The Roman Military Inspection
CJ|0|53|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH and Mary immediately set out on the short trip, and Joseph's oldest son accompanied them, showing them the way to the fortress where Cyrenius was staying.
CJ|0|53|2|0|When they arrived at the great square, behold, it was completely filled with soldiers, so that it was very difficult to reach the entrance of the fortress.
CJ|0|53|3|0|At this Joseph advised Mary, 'Beloved wife, see, what is impossible for us human beings, will remain impossible for us.
CJ|0|53|4|0|Consequently it is now utterly impossible to reach the fortress through all these rows of soldiers, so we should turn right back again and await a more favorable time.
CJ|0|53|5|0|The Baby also looks at these rough rows of warriors quite timidly. He could easily become frightened and become sick after that, and we would then be to blame, so let us go back!'
CJ|0|53|6|0|And Mary said, 'Beloved Joseph! See, if my eyes do not deceive me, then that man who is walking in front of this last row with a shining helmet on his head is none other than Cyrenius!
CJ|0|53|7|0|So let us wait a little until he gets over here. Perhaps he will notice us and then he will surely give us a hint as to what we are to do - whether we should come to him or not.
CJ|0|53|8|0|Joseph replied, 'Yes, beloved wife, you are right, it obviously is Cyrenius himself.
CJ|0|53|9|0|But just look quite sharply at the other warrior who walks beside him. If that is not the notorious prefect of Jerusalem my name is not Joseph.
CJ|0|53|10|0|What is he doing here? Could his presence concern us? Could Cyrenius thus most shamefully have delivered us over to Herod?
CJ|0|53|11|0|The best part of the matter is that he surely does not know you and me personally, so we can still save ourselves by a new flight deeper into Egypt.
CJ|0|53|12|0|But if he knew me or you, we would already be lost, for he is now hardly more than twenty steps away from us and could have us seized immediately.
CJ|0|53|13|0|So let us withdraw in all haste - for if we are seen by Cyrenius, who surely still knows us well, we are lost!'
CJ|0|53|14|0|At this Mary took fright and wanted to flee back at once. But the pressure of the crowd permitted no flight here, for curiosity drew so many people to the square that it was as good as impossible to push one's way through.
CJ|0|53|15|0|Joseph therefore said, 'What is impossible, is just impossible. Let us therefore resign ourselves to God's will! The Lord will surely not leave us this time either!
CJ|0|53|16|0|But as a precaution let us put our heads right closely together, so that at least Cyrenius does not recognize us by our faces.'
CJ|0|53|17|0|On this occasion Cyrenius came quite close to Joseph and pushed him a bit out of the way. But Joseph could not give way because of the pressing throng; hence Cyrenius looked at his unbudging man more closely and promptly recognized Joseph.
CJ|0|53|18|0|And when he caught sight of Joseph and Mary and the at him smiling Child, his eyes became filled with tears of joy - yes, he was so overjoyed that he could hardly speak.
CJ|0|53|19|0|But he regained his composure as quickly as possible, grasped Joseph's hand in haste, pressed it to his heart and said,
CJ|0|53|20|0|'My venerated friend! You see my preoccupation!
CJ|0|53|21|0|Oh forgive me that I have not been able to visit you sooner, but the review is just completed. I shall immediately let the troops withdraw to their quarters,
CJ|0|53|22|0|give the garrison commander my short orders for tomorrow, then promptly change uniform and join you here to lead you to your home.'
CJ|0|53|23|0|Still full of joy he then turned to Mary and to the Child and asked, while at the same time caressing the Baby,
CJ|0|53|24|0|'O my Life, my all, do You still know me? Do You love me, my loveliest little Child?'
CJ|0|53|25|0|And the little Child spread His little hands widely toward Cyrenius, smiled at him tenderly and then said clearly:
CJ|0|53|26|0|'Oh Cyrenius! I well know you and love you, because you love Me so much! Come, come to Me - for I must be sure to bless you!'
CJ|0|53|27|0|This was too much for Cyrenius' heart, and he took the Baby in his arms, pressed Him to his bosom and declared,
CJ|0|53|28|0|'Yes, my Life, with You on my arms I will give the command for a long peace among the nations!'
CJ|0|53|29|0|He now called the commander over, let him know that he was wholly satisfied and told him to let the troops withdraw and to provide for them for three days at his expense as governor, and then invited the commander as well as several centurions to a good meal at Joseph's villa.
CJ|0|53|30|0|And he himself, while carrying the Baby and accompanied by the ever more wondering Maronius Pilla, immediately went as he was out to the villa with Joseph and Mary and there promptly had his servants prepare a festive meal. Now this caused a great sensation in the city, for all the people were inflamed with love for Cyrenius since they found him to be such a great friend of children.
CJ|0|54|1|1|Cyrenius Dispels Joseph's Fears
CJ|0|54|1|0|JOSEPH WAS PLEASED with all this and fervently praised the Lord God in his heart for this most happy turn in a matter which had caused him anxious concern.
CJ|0|54|2|0|But for all that he was somewhat ill at ease over Maronius, for he still did not know just what this friend of Herod was doing here.
CJ|0|54|3|0|While on the way to the villa he therefore went over to Cyrenius without being noticed and asked him in a low tone of voice,
CJ|0|54|4|0|'Noble friend of mankind! Is not this warrior who there walks ahead of you the Maronius of Jerusalem?
CJ|0|54|5|0|If it is he, this friend of Herod, just what is he doing here?
CJ|0|54|6|0|Could he possibly have gotten wind of me and wants to seek me out here and take me prisoner?
CJ|0|54|7|0|Oh noble friend of mankind, do not leave me in this anxious uncertainty any longer!'
CJ|0|54|8|0|Here Cyrenius took Joseph's hand and also said to him in a low voice,
CJ|0|54|9|0|'My very dear, venerable friend, do not fear the in fact former prefect of Jerusalem in the least.
CJ|0|54|10|0|For you shall convince yourself still today that he has a far greater reason to fear you than you have to fear him.
CJ|0|54|11|0|See, he no longer is prefect in Jerusalem but is now, as you see him, my complete prisoner, and will not assume his office again until he is fully healed.
CJ|0|54|12|0|I took him along precisely on your account, for when I examined him because of the abomination in Palestine,
CJ|0|54|13|0|he then stated that he knew you and Mary personally. But as it now turns out, he knows neither you nor your wife Mary!
CJ|0|54|14|0|And that is in fact very good grist for our mill.
CJ|0|54|15|0|He has not been told that you are here, so you must not give yourself away in any respect.
CJ|0|54|16|0|For he only expects to meet a very wise man here who will reveal his inmost thoughts to him,
CJ|0|54|17|0|and that is none other than you yourself! That is why I took him along, as I said before, so he should become acquainted with the wise man in you and be tested by you for his own good.
CJ|0|54|18|0|For that reason he already fears you beyond measure and, judging from his very pale appearance, strongly suspects that you are the man mentioned by me.
CJ|0|54|19|0|From these few words you can be fully at ease for now, and what follows will make everything very plain to you.'
CJ|0|54|20|0|When Joseph heard this from Cyrenius he was very glad, and secretly instructed Mary and the oldest son how they were to act toward Maronius so nothing of the plan of Cyrenius would be given away. Thus the villa was soon reached at an easy pace and the meal prepared, as already said.
CJ|0|55|1|1|Cyrenius Learns Wisdom From The Baby
CJ|0|55|1|0|WHEN THE MEAL was ready, the invited guests came into the dining room. Cyrenius, who was still coaxing the Baby which played with him and also caressed him, then gave the Baby back to Mary and gave the sign for the meal to begin.
CJ|0|55|2|0|All now sat down at the freshly-set table - but Mary, since she had no fine clothes, went into a side room and sat down at the table with Joseph's sons.
CJ|0|55|3|0|Cyrenius soon noticed this, hastened after the dear mother and said,
CJ|0|55|4|0|'Oh most charming mother of This my Life, what are you trying to do?
CJ|0|55|5|0|You and your Child are of the foremost concern to me - you are the queen of our gathering, and now you are the very one who does not wish to take part in my feast of celebration which I had arranged here especially for you!
CJ|0|55|6|0|Oh no, that is altogether out of the question! So hurry and come into the dining room and sit on my right - and on my left sits your husband!
CJ|0|55|7|0|But Mary responded, 'Oh see, dear sir, my clothes are very shabby - how will they look at your glittering side?'
CJ|0|55|8|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Oh dear mother, if my golden clothes, which mean absolutely nothing to me, should bother you, I would immediately throw them aside and don a common sailor's frock just so I would not miss you at my table!'
CJ|0|55|9|0|Since Mary was convinced of the great humility of Cyrenius, she returned and sat down at the table beside Cyrenius with the Child on her arms.
CJ|0|55|10|0|As they all sat at the table, the Baby constantly looked at Cyrenius and smiled, while Cyrenius also could not take his eyes off the Child for all his love of Him.
CJ|0|55|11|0|For a short time Cyrenius held out, but then his love for the Child became too great
CJ|0|55|12|0|and he asked the dear little One, 'Am I not right, my Life - You would like to come to me again on my arms?'
CJ|0|55|13|0|And the Baby smiled sweetly at Cyrenius and again said quite distinctly:
CJ|0|55|14|0|'Oh My beloved Cyrenius, I come to you very gladly - because you love Me so much, I also love you so much!'
CJ|0|55|15|0|At this Cyrenius quickly stretched out his arms to the Child, took Him to himself and caressed Him fervently.
CJ|0|55|16|0|Her Mary banteringly admonished the Baby, 'Now be sure that You do not get any dirt on the Lord Cyrenius!'
CJ|0|55|17|0|And Cyrenius said in deep emotion, 'Oh dear mother! I do indeed wish that I were clean enough to worthily carry this Child on my arms!
CJ|0|55|18|0|This Child can only make me clean, but never dirty me!'
CJ|0|55|19|0|Thereupon he again turned to the Child and asked, 'My dear little Child, is it not true, I am still very unclean and very unworthy to carry You?'
CJ|0|55|20|0|Here the Baby again said distinctly: 'Cyrenius, whoever loves Me as you do, he is clean - and I love him as he loves Me!'
CJ|0|55|21|0|Cyrenius, quite enchanted, continued to ask the Baby, saying, 'But how is it, my dear little Child, that You, while hardly a few months old, already speak so sensibly and clearly? Did Your dear mother teach You that?'
CJ|0|55|22|0|And the Baby, smiling very gently, sat up on the arms of Cyrenius and stated like a little lord:
CJ|0|55|23|0|'Cyrenius, that does not depend on one's age or learning, but on the greatness of one's spirit. Only the body and the soul must learn - but the spirit already has everything in it from God.
CJ|0|55|24|0|Now My Spirit is full of power from God - that is why I am able to speak so soon!'
CJ|0|55|25|0|This answer caused the utmost astonishment in Cyrenius as well as among the entire company, and the garrison commander asserted, 'By Zeus, this Child even now puts all of the world's wise men to shame with this answer! What by comparison are Plato, Socrates and a hundred other wise men? And what great things will this Child accomplish when He grows to manhood? - And Cyrenius responded, 'Certainly more than our wise men along with all our gods!'
CJ|0|56|1|1|Maronius Pilla Discards Some Pagan Views
CJ|0|56|1|0|SOON AFTER these wondrous words of the Baby, Cyrenius turned to the constantly more paling Maronius and asked him,
CJ|0|56|2|0|'Maronius Pilla, what do you say to this Child? Have you ever seen or heard anything like it?
CJ|0|56|3|0|Is that not obviously more than our myth about Zeus, according to which he was suckled by a she-goat on an island?
CJ|0|56|4|0|Or by far more than the questionable tradition of the founders of Rome, suckled by a shewolf?
CJ|0|56|5|0|Speak, what do you think of this? For that is why you are my companion, so you should hear, see, and learn something and then express an opinion about it before me!'
CJ|0|56|6|0|At this Maronius Pilla gathered his wits as well as he could and replied,
CJ|0|56|7|0|'Exalted ruler of Asia and Egypt, what shall I, a poor simpleton say here, when the greatest of the old philosophers would have to fall silent and the wisdom of Apollo and Minerva is humbled as pitifully as tin is hammered thin on the glowing anvil of Vulkan?
CJ|0|56|8|0|Here I can only say: It has pleased the gods to put a most wise God out of their midst on the earth; and Egypt as the old cradle favored by all the gods, a land in which snow and ice are unknown, must also be the homeland of this God from the midst of all the gods!'
CJ|0|56|9|0|Cyrenius, smiling a little, said, 'In a way you are right;
CJ|0|56|10|0|but see here, you seem to have erred in that you called this Child a child from the midst of all the gods.
CJ|0|56|11|0|Now mark this, here on both sides of me sit the Child's father and mother, and they are after all human beings like both of us.
CJ|0|56|12|0|How then should a God-Child from the midst of all the gods come into being by them?
CJ|0|56|13|0|Besides, the lofty inhabitants of Olympus would obviously have put a very dangerous bee in their bonnet, since the enormous superiority of the Child's wisdom would soon have caused their downfall.
CJ|0|56|14|0|I therefore beg you to reconsider, for otherwise you will run the risk that all the gods will assail you at once for expressing yourself thus and will set you, while still alive, before Minos, Aeakus and Rhadamantus and thereafter place you at the side of Tantalus!'
CJ|0|56|15|0|At this Maronius was startled and replied after a while, 'Consular, imperial highness! I believe that the court of the three judges of the underworld has just about ceased to exist, and the gods, as it appears to me, also seem to have deserted their Olympus in considerable numbers.
CJ|0|56|16|0|If we honored only wise men, who surely did not get their wisdom from mud puddles, we would soon learn to get along without the advice of our gods.
CJ|0|56|17|0|Truly, the words of this wonder-Child already mean more to me than three Olympi full of freshly-baked gods!'
CJ|0|56|18|0|Here Cyrenius said, 'Maronius, if you really mean that, then everything is forgiven you - but first we will have to discuss the matter at much greater length! But no more for the present.'
CJ|0|57|1|1|The Full Confession Of Maronius
CJ|0|57|1|0|AFTER THE MEAL, which with Cyrenius never lasted more than two hours, the commander and the centurions returned to the city under strict orders to accord Cyrenius no further marks of esteem on this day.
CJ|0|57|2|0|When all had departed, Cyrenius really began to examine Maronius 'ad coram' - to the heart.
CJ|0|57|3|0|He therefore asked him in the presence of Joseph and of Mary, who again had the Baby on her arms,
CJ|0|57|4|0|'Maronius! In Tyre, when I examined you after Herod, you solemnly assured me that you personally knew that certain upright carpenter Joseph from the country around Nazareth -
CJ|0|57|5|0|as well as a certain Mary, whom the carpenter is supposed to have taken out of the temple as his wife or merely into his care.
CJ|0|57|6|0|So let me have a closer description in this matter right now while we are at our good leisure here with my host.
CJ|0|57|7|0|A few days ago I found out that this family is actually supposed to be living here in Egypt and is said to be an altogether different one than that which my brother delivered up to me, which is still kept in safe custody under my care.
CJ|0|57|8|0|For you will surely have that much feeling of what is right and of humanitarianism, despite your abominable association with Herod, to acknowledge that it would be most cruel to keep innocent people - no matter from where they are - prisoners without just cause.
CJ|0|57|9|0|Do therefore give me a sure description of the notorious pair, so I can seek them out in this region and imprison them, for our laws of state strictly require that.
CJ|0|57|10|0|Now I am entitled to demand this from you all the more, because you yourself admitted to me that you personally knew this family, whose actual seizure must be of the greatest importance to me.'
CJ|0|57|11|0|At this Maronius again was greatly taken aback and did not know what he should say, for he had seen neither Joseph nor Mary before.
CJ|0|57|12|0|After a while he finally admitted in a stuttering voice,
CJ|0|57|13|0|'Consular, imperial highness! trusting in your kindness and consideration, I must finally assure you and confirm under oath by Zeus and all other gods that I do not in the least know the said Joseph as well as that certain Mary!
CJ|0|57|14|0|My confession in Tyre was only an empty evasion as I then still wilfully sought to deceive you.
CJ|0|57|15|0|But I have now become convinced that you just cannot be deceived; therefore my will has also changed and I have accordingly told you the whole truth.'
CJ|0|57|16|0|Here Cyrenius winked to Joseph, who wanted to speak, to be silent for the time being and said to Maronius,
CJ|0|57|17|0|'Well, if that is how I stand with you, then we will have to continue to face one another and discuss the matter a bit longer, for only now do I see in you a man altogether dangerous to the state! Therefore you are now answerable to me under oath to each of my questions.'
CJ|0|58|1|1|Joseph Renders A Verdict
CJ|0|58|1|0|MARONIUS THEREUPON said to Cyrenius, 'Consular, imperial highness! Just how should I still be under suspicion of the state as a follower of Herod?
CJ|0|58|2|0|For I now realize that this ruthless tyrant strives after the sole mastery of Asia!
CJ|0|58|3|0|Should I perhaps assist him in that? How would that be possible? With the handful of followers in Jerusalem Herod could at most attack the children of the Jews.
CJ|0|58|4|0|This act of violence has already brought upon him such a rebuff that he will keep his hands off a similar undertaking for all time!
CJ|0|58|5|0|Besides, I was tool of necessity and had to act according to the will of the tyrant because he threatened me with Rome.
CJ|0|58|6|0|And since I know from you quite clearly how matters stand and in addition have no more power in my hands nor want to have any again,
CJ|0|58|7|0|I truly cannot comprehend how and in what manner I am still supposed to be a man dangerous to the state?
CJ|0|58|8|0|Keep me with you as an eternal hostage of my faithfulness to Rome, and you will make me happier than if you restore me to my prefecture!'
CJ|0|58|9|0|These words Maronius spoke quite seriously, and no ambiguity was noticeable in his utterance.
CJ|0|58|10|0|Cyrenius therefore assured him, 'Good, my brother, I will believe you in what you have spoken, for I have now found much earnestness in your words.
CJ|0|58|11|0|But one thing I am still lacking to wholly confirm the truth of your words, and that is the judgment of that wise man whom I already mentioned to you in Tyre.
CJ|0|58|12|0|And behold, this man, this oracle of all oracles stands here before us!
CJ|0|58|13|0|This man sees through you into your innermost thoughts. So let us now ask him what he thinks of you.
CJ|0|58|14|0|And it shall be done to you according to his verdict. If he again restores you as prefect of Jerusalem, then you will be appointed as prefect of Jerusalem even today.
CJ|0|58|15|0|But if for most wise and good reasons he does not do that, then you will remain my hostage!'
CJ|0|58|16|0|Here Joseph was asked in the matter, and he said, 'Noble friend Cyrenius! As far as I am concerned Maronius is now clean, and you can restore him to his place without misgivings.
CJ|0|58|17|0|For we are kept in the hand of the almighty, eternal God - what power shall then be able to rise up against us?'
CJ|0|58|18|0|To this Cyrenius lifted his hand and affirmed, 'Then I also swear to you, Maronius Pilla, by the living God of this wise man, that from now on you are again the prefect of Jerusalem!'
CJ|0|58|19|0|But Maronius said, 'Give this office to someone else, and keep me with you as your friend, for that makes me happier!'
CJ|0|58|20|0|And Cyrenius answered, 'Then be my companion in office as long as Herod continues to live, and only then governor of the whole land of the Jews!' - This offer Maronius gratefully accepted.
CJ|0|59|1|1|A Prophecy Of Joseph Is Fulfilled
CJ|0|59|1|0|JOSPEH NOW asked Maronius, 'Since I have discerned by the great grace of my Lord and God that no ill will remain in you,
CJ|0|59|2|0|I would like to hear what you think of Herod, since you must have noticed how his heart is disposed toward the children that he murdered because of the new King of the Jews.
CJ|0|59|3|0|Was it not softened by the most innocent blood of the children, by the anguished wailing of the mothers?
CJ|0|59|4|0|What would he do if he should find out by a new report that among the many murdered children he nevertheless did not murder the right One?
CJ|0|59|5|0|What if he should find out that the right Child were still alive quite safe and sound somewhere in Judea or Palestine?'
CJ|0|59|6|0|At this Maronius looked at Joseph in a greatly puzzled manner and replied after a while,
CJ|0|59|7|0|'Truly wise man, all I can tell you there is this -
CJ|0|59|8|0|If you were to make the worst possible use of your wisdom and would demand of Herod ten thousand pounds of gold in return for which you would for certain betray the right Child to him,
CJ|0|59|9|0|truly, you would receive this enormous sum in advance!
CJ|0|59|10|0|For gold is nothing to that blood-thirsty villain compared to his lust for power.
CJ|0|59|11|0|Since he has so much gold that he could build houses from pure gold, he hardly looks at it, and if he could secure the throne for himself, he would slay a world full of people for it and throw all his gold into the sea.
CJ|0|59|12|0|See, at first he also wanted to bribe me heavily with gold, diamonds, rubies and the largest pearls,
CJ|0|59|13|0|but my genuinely Roman patrician code of ethics strictly rebuked the old bloodhound in this.
CJ|0|59|14|0|That inflamed his anger all the more, and he threatened to expose me to Rome on the basis of his seeming patriotism.
CJ|0|59|15|0|Only then was I forced to do what he wanted and no way out was possible for me, for he gave me a document by his own hand which stated that he took the responsibility for the whole matter with Rome upon himself.
CJ|0|59|16|0|Therefore I was forced to act as is surely known to you.
CJ|0|59|17|0|That accordingly nothing good is to be expected from his heart to this hour you can be fully assured of!
CJ|0|59|18|0|I believe that I hardly need to tell you who are such a very wise man any more about this veritable king of all furies, about this living Medusa-head!'
CJ|0|59|19|0|And Joseph said, 'May the eternal One, true God bless you for these faithful words!
CJ|0|59|20|0|Believe me, you will become convinced of it: this scourge of mankind will have a crown, for which he is so bloodthirsty, set upon his head while still in the flesh by the eternally just God that will cause all the world to wonder!'
CJ|0|59|21|0|Here the Baby raised up Its hand and again said very plainly: 'Herod, Herod, I have no curse for you - but you shall carry a crown in this world which will become a great torment to you and will pain you more than the gold which you had to pay to Rome!'
CJ|0|59|22|0|At the time the Baby spoke this in Egypt, Herod was covered with lice, and his household servants had their hands full throughout the remainder of Herod's life to cleanse him from lice, which constantly increased in numbers and finally caused his death.
CJ|0|60|1|1|The Long Arm Of The Baby
CJ|0|60|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS heard this from Maronius Pilla and also the declaration of Joseph and that of the Baby, he was thoroughly shocked and exclaimed,
CJ|0|60|2|0|'Oh you eternal powers of a most high Ruler of the universe! Have you no more lightnings to hurl upon this monster of a vassal of Rome?
CJ|0|60|3|0|Oh Augustus Caesar, my good brother! Which of the furies did that day bedazzle your eyes when you invested this monster, this outcast from the lowest Tartarus, from the true Orkus, with Palestine and Judea?
CJ|0|60|4|0|No, no that is too much to hear at one time! - Maronius, why did you not tell me anything about that when Herod stood trial before me in Tyre?
CJ|0|60|5|0|According to my jurisdiction I there would instantly have had his Medusa-head struck from his body,
CJ|0|60|6|0|and a worthy vassal would long have been standing in the place of this monster from Greece!
CJ|0|60|7|0|But what can I do now? He has fulfilled his penance. Now I cannot impose another on him, may not punish him further.
CJ|0|60|8|0|But just wait, you old bloodhound, you hyena of hyenas! A hunt shall be organized for you of which all the furies have never dreamt!'
CJ|0|60|9|0|Maronius, Joseph and Mary quaked before the fury of Cyrenius, for they did not know what all Cyrenius might undertake.
CJ|0|60|10|0|No one dared to ask him a question, for too stirred up was his soul.
CJ|0|60|11|0|The Baby alone showed no fear of the powerful voice of Cyrenius, but constantly looked him calmly in the face.
CJ|0|60|12|0|And when Cyrenius' storm had somewhat subsided, the Baby again said quite plainly to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|60|13|0|'Oh Cyrenius! Listen to Me! Come here to Me, take Me on your arms, and carry Me out into the open. There I will show you something!'
CJ|0|60|14|0|These words acted as balsam upon the sore heart of Cyrenius, and he promptly went over to the Baby with open arms and filled with love he tenderly took Him on his arms and in the company of Joseph and Mary and Maronius Pilla carried Him out into the open.
CJ|0|60|15|0|When He arrived in the open, the Baby promptly asked Cyrenius in plainly discernible words:
CJ|0|60|16|0|'Cyrenius, which of us two do you suppose has the longer arm? Measure Mine against yours!'
CJ|0|60|17|0|This question appeared strange to Cyrenius and he did not know what he should answer the Child thereto, for he obviously saw his own to be three times as long as both of the Child's together.
CJ|0|60|18|0|And the Baby said again: 'Cyrenius, you consider your arm to be much longer than Mine.
CJ|0|60|19|0|But I tell you that Mine is nevertheless much longer than yours!
CJ|0|60|20|0|Do you see there at a considerable distance from us a high pillar, decorated with an idol?
CJ|0|60|21|0|Reach over to it from here with your longer arm, tear it down, and then pulverize it with your fingers!'
CJ|0|60|22|0|Here Cyrenius, still more taken aback than before, declared after a short pause, 'My dear little Child, my Life - that is surely impossible to anyone but God!'
CJ|0|60|23|0|And the Baby stretched His arm toward the pillar, which was a good thousand paces away - and the pillar tumbled down and quickly turned to dust.
CJ|0|60|24|0|Thereupon the Baby said to Cyrenius: 'So do not concern yourself in vain about Herod, for My arm obviously reaches farther than yours! Herod has his reward - but you forgive him as I have forgiven him, and you will be better off! For he too is a blind son of the earth!' - These words took all the anger out of Cyrenius, and he secretly began to worship the Child in all earnestness.
CJ|0|61|1|1|Maronius Makes Some Wrong Conclusions
CJ|0|61|1|0|MARONIUS PILLA was so greatly startled at this marvelous manifestation that his whole body trembled like the leaves of an aspen-tree during a great storm.
CJ|0|61|2|0|Joseph soon saw the great distress of Maronius, therefore went directly over to him and asked,
CJ|0|61|3|0|'Maronius Pilla, why do you tremble so greatly? Has anyone done you harm?'
CJ|0|61|4|0|Maronius answered Joseph, 'Oh man, you who do not have the likes of you on earth, for you it is easy - for you are a god whom all the elements must obey!
CJ|0|61|5|0|But I am only a weak mortal subject to death, whose life as well as the existence of yonder pillar rests in your hand.
CJ|0|61|6|0|With your thoughts you can destroy me as well as a whole world in an instant.
CJ|0|61|7|0|So why should I not tremble before you who are surely the mightiest ancestral father of all our gods, if they really should happen to exist somewhere?
CJ|0|61|8|0|Yonder pillar was already dedicated to Jupiter Stator since time immemorial. All storms and lightnings shuddered back before it in great awe.
CJ|0|61|9|0|And now even your minor Child destroys it. Now if your Child can do such, what power must be based in you?
CJ|0|61|10|0|So allow yourself to be worshiped by me a most unworthy worm of the earth!'
CJ|0|61|11|0|Here Joseph said, 'Listen, friend and brother Maronius, you are greatly mistaken!
CJ|0|61|12|0|I am no more than you, therefore only a mortal man. Now if you on your life can be silent before all the world, I will tell you something.
CJ|0|61|13|0|But if you are not silent you will not fare much better than did yonder pillar.
CJ|0|61|14|0|So then listen to me if you wish and if you can trust yourself.'
CJ|0|61|15|0|But Maronius begged Joseph on his knees to tell him nothing whatever, for he might after all let something slip accidentally and then he would be lost.
CJ|0|61|16|0|And Joseph said, 'Have no fear whatever of that, for the Lord of heaven and earth never chastises anyone for a mere accident.
CJ|0|61|17|0|So you may listen to me quite without fear; what I shall tell you will not be your undoing, but will save you eternally.'
CJ|0|61|18|0|At this Cyrenius, while worshiping the Child and still caressing Him upon his arms, went over to Joseph and said to him,
CJ|0|61|19|0|'My best and dearest friend! Leave Maronius to me, and I will prepare him today myself while he is with me, and you can then give him the higher initiation tomorrow.'
CJ|0|61|20|0|To this Joseph agreed and promptly returned to the house accompanied by the others.
CJ|0|62|1|1|Joseph Discourses On The Brother-Eye
CJ|0|62|1|0|WHEN EVENING CAME Cyrenius said to Joseph, 'My friend, my godly brother, how very sorry I am that I cannot spend the night here with you.
CJ|0|62|2|0|And how sorry I am that I must set tomorrow aside for the business of state until the afternoon.
CJ|0|62|3|0|But around the third hour of the afternoon I shall return to you with Maronius, and you can then give him the higher initiation after my lesser initiation.
CJ|0|62|4|0|It means a great deal to me to see this in other matters so well-informed man saved by means of your God's holy school of life, which I hold to be the only true and living one!'
CJ|0|62|5|0|Joseph responded: 'Yes, eminent friend, that is just and fair. For nothing pleases the Lord more, than that we act with love toward our enemies and are concerned for their timely and eternal welfare!
CJ|0|62|6|0|Let us look upon every sinner as an errant brother, and God will then look upon us as His errant children,
CJ|0|62|7|0|but otherwise only as creatures of ill will who always come under His judgments and suffer death like the ephemerids.
CJ|0|62|8|0|'Behold, that is why the Lord has given us human beings two eyes and only one mouth for speaking, so we should with the one eye look upon men only as men, but with the other as brothers.
CJ|0|62|9|0|If men then err before us, we should open our brother-eye and close the eye reserved for men.
CJ|0|62|10|0|But if our brothers err before us, we then should close our brother-eye and direct the eye reserved for men upon ourselves and thereafter look upon ourselves as errant men in regard to our errant brothers.
CJ|0|62|11|0|With our one mouth we should all confess one Lord, one God, and one Father, and He will acknowledge us all as His children!
CJ|0|62|12|0|For God also has two eyes and one mouth. With the one eye He sees His creatures - and with the other His children.
CJ|0|62|13|0|If we regard each other with the brother-eye, then the Father looks upon us with the Father-eye -
CJ|0|62|14|0|but if we regard each other only with the eye reserved for men, then God looks upon us only with the eye of the Creator, while His also only one mouth declares His love to His children, but judgment to His creatures!
CJ|0|62|15|0|Thus it is only fitting and proper that we should concern ourselves for our brother Maronius.'
CJ|0|62|16|0|Here Joseph blessed Cyrenius and Maronius, who then went into the city with their aides while Joseph looked after his household.
CJ|0|63|1|1|James Repents His Vain Curiosity
CJ|0|63|1|0|IN THE EVENING Mary laid the already tired Baby into the crib which Joseph had made after arriving in Ostracine.
CJ|0|63|2|0|James, Joseph's youngest son, was the Baby tender as usual and rocked the Baby so He would go to sleep,
CJ|0|63|3|0|while Mary prepared the evening meal in the kitchen.
CJ|0|63|4|0|Now James would have been pleased if the Baby had gone to sleep somewhat earlier this time, for he was very anxious to watch the lighting-up of a triumphal arch outside with his brothers, which had been erected near the villa only recently in honor of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|63|5|0|James therefore rocked the Baby diligently and sang and whistled thereby.
CJ|0|63|6|0|But the Baby just would not go to sleep - as soon as he ceased rocking, the Baby promptly began to stir again and let the cradler know that He was still awake.
CJ|0|63|7|0|This brought the Baby-tender almost to despair, since it had already become very bright outside from the many burning torches.
CJ|0|63|8|0|He therefore decided to leave the Baby for a little while even though He was still awake, so he might gape a bit at the spectacle outside.
CJ|0|63|9|0|But when James thus partly arose, the Baby said: 'James, if you desert Me now, matters shall fare badly with you!
CJ|0|63|10|0|Am I not worth more than the foolish spectacle outside and your vain curiosity?
CJ|0|63|11|0|See, all the stars and all the angels envy you your service which you are now doing Me, and you are filled with impatience because of Me and want to leave Me?
CJ|0|63|12|0|Truly, if you do that, then you are not worthy to have Me as a Brother!
CJ|0|63|13|0|You are quite at liberty to go outside if the spectacle of the world is dearer to you than I.
CJ|0|63|14|0|See, the whole room is full of angels who are ready to serve Me if your small and easy service to Me is burdensome to you.'
CJ|0|63|15|0|These words suddenly deprived James of all desire to go outside;
CJ|0|63|16|0|he remained by the crib and asked the Baby with all his heart to forgive him and diligently continued to rock Him.
CJ|0|63|17|0|And the Baby said to James: 'Everything is forgiven you, but another time never let the world tempt you!
CJ|0|63|18|0|For I am more than all the world, all the heavens and all human beings and angels!'
CJ|0|63|19|0|These words nearly cost James his life, for he became subtly aware just who really dwelt in the Child.
CJ|0|63|20|0|Mary, Joseph and the other four sons now came into the room and sat down at the table, whereupon James promptly related what had taken place.
CJ|0|64|1|1|Joseph Counts God's Love As Man's Greatest Wealth
CJ|0|64|1|0|WHEN JAMES had finished his story, Joseph said to him,
CJ|0|64|2|0|'Yes, so it is and has always been and will always be - one must love God more in the least of His works than all the splendors of the world!
CJ|0|64|3|0|For what after all can all the gaudy splendors of the world give a human soul?
CJ|0|64|4|0|David himself had to flee before his own son, and Solomon finally had to bitterly taste the displeasure of the Lord because he strove too much after the splendors of the world.
CJ|0|64|5|0|Now God gives us new life with every second, so why should we not love Him more in the least of His works than all the world, which passes away and is filled with carrion and rubbish!
CJ|0|64|6|0|And we are all convinced among ourselves that this our Baby is from above and is called God's Son.
CJ|0|64|7|0|He is therefore no trifling part of God, and it is also but reasonable that we love Him more than all the world.
CJ|0|64|8|0|Look at the pagan Cyrenius. It is not because of us that he is kind to us, but because of the Baby, for his heart tells him that according to his concepts a most high Deity stands in closest contact with this our Child, which is why he fears and loves Him.
CJ|0|64|9|0|Now if a pagan does this, how much more then must we do so, who fully know whence this Baby came and who His Father is!
CJ|0|64|10|0|Therefore all our attention should be directed toward this Baby at all times, for the Child is more than we and all the world!
CJ|0|64|11|0|Take an example from me also, and see how many sacrifices I, an old man, have already made for this God-Child!
CJ|0|64|12|0|But I made them freely and with great love, because I love God more than all the world.
CJ|0|64|13|0|Now did we ever lose anything on account of that? - Oh, no! We have still gained after each sacrifice!
CJ|0|64|14|0|All of you therefore do and think the same and you will never lose anything, but only gain greatly at all times!
CJ|0|64|15|0|Besides, this Child is anyhow of such a gentle nature that it is truly a joy to be with Him.
CJ|0|64|16|0|Only very rarely does He cry. He has never been sick, and when one coaxes Him, He looks about so blithely and cheerfully and smiles at every human being in such a cordial way that one is touched to tears by Him.
CJ|0|64|17|0|And now that He also has wondrously begun to speak all at once, one could just overwhelm Him from sheer love!
CJ|0|64|18|0|Therefore, my children, consider well who this Baby is, and be sure to tend and take care of Him with all possible care!
CJ|0|64|19|0|For otherwise He could fittingly punish you if, as our greatest wealth, you should value Him less than all the meaningless follies of the world.
CJ|0|64|20|0|These words brought all the five sons to tears, and all arose from the table and gathered around the crib of the Child.
CJ|0|64|21|0|At this the Baby looked at His brothers in a most friendly way, blessed them and said, 'Oh brothers, become as I am if you want to be eternally happy!' And the brothers wept and ate nothing that evening.
CJ|0|65|1|1|The Violent Storm
CJ|0|65|1|0|BUT THE SONS of Joseph did not want to leave the cradle at all, for too great was their love for their divine little Brother.
CJ|0|65|2|0|Since it had already become quite late, Joseph said to the sons,
CJ|0|65|3|0|'You now have sufficiently shown that you love the Baby.
CJ|0|65|4|0|It is late at night and tomorrow will again dawn early, so you may retire in the name of the Lord.
CJ|0|65|5|0|The Baby is already asleep, so place the crib carefully beside the bed of the mother and then go to your bedchamber.'
CJ|0|65|6|0|Joseph had just finished speaking, when the Baby opened His eyes and said:
CJ|0|65|7|0|'Remain here for the night, all of you, and set the bedchamber aside for strangers who will take refuge here even tonight.
CJ|0|65|8|0|For a most violent storm will soon overrun this region, the like of which has never been seen here.
CJ|0|65|9|0|But let none of you be afraid, for not a hair on anyone's head will be harmed thereby!
CJ|0|65|10|0|And be sure to bar no doors because of it, so the fugitives may save themselves in this house!'
CJ|0|65|11|0|Joseph was alarmed at this prediction of the Child and quickly went outside to see from whence the mighty storm would come.
CJ|0|65|12|0|But when he was outside, he could not see even a small cloud anywhere; the sky was wholly clear and not a breeze stirred.
CJ|0|65|13|0|A silence of the grave was spread over the whole country and there was no whisper of an approaching storm.
CJ|0|65|14|0|Therefore Joseph promptly went back, gave God the glory and remarked,
CJ|0|65|15|0|'The Child probably dreamt, for there is no sign whatever of a storm.
CJ|0|65|16|0|The sky is clear in all directions and not a breeze stirs - from where should a storm come?'
CJ|0|65|17|0|Joseph had hardly finished speaking these words, when suddenly a clap was heard as from a thousand thunders. The earth quaked so violently that a number of houses and temples collapsed in the city.
CJ|0|65|18|0|Immediately thereafter such a violent tempest began to rage that tall waves from the nearby sea were driven into the city, and all the people, awakened by the mighty earth-shock, rushed out of the city to the more highly situated suburbs.
CJ|0|65|19|0|Cyrenius himself with Maronius and all his aids soon came in hasty flight to Joseph in the villa and hurriedly sketched the scenes of horror that were caused by the earthquake and the storm.
CJ|0|65|20|0|Hereupon Joseph quieted Cyrenius by immediately telling him what the Baby had said a short while ago. At this Cyrenius began to breathe more easily and the raging of the storm ceased to alarm him, for he felt himself to be well protected.
CJ|0|66|1|1|The Master Of The Storm
CJ|0|66|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS had regained his composure, he went to the crib and regarded the Child, his breast filled with great thoughts.
CJ|0|66|2|0|The Baby slept quite calmly and the terrible raging of the storm did not disturb His sleep.
CJ|0|66|3|0|But in a short time the hurricane began to thrust so fiercely against the building that Cyrenius feared it might collapse.
CJ|0|66|4|0|He therefore said to Joseph, 'Esteemed friend! I believe that because of the constantly increasing power of the storm we would do better to leave this building.
CJ|0|66|5|0|For how easily can a mighty whirlwind seize this - although firm - building and bury us all beneath the rubble!
CJ|0|66|6|0|Therefore we would do better to take flight early, since we cannot be sure that the same thing may not happen here as well as in the city!'
CJ|0|66|7|0|Here the Baby suddenly reopened His heavenly, divine eyes, immediately recognized Cyrenius and said to him very clearly:
CJ|0|66|8|0|'Cyrenius, when you are with Me, you need not be afraid of this storm -
CJ|0|66|9|0|for also the storms, like all the world, lie in the hand of your God!
CJ|0|66|10|0|The storms are necessary and must put to flight the hatched-out evil of hell!
CJ|0|66|11|0|But they can never harm those who are around Me, for the storms also know their Master and do not do what they do planlessly.
CJ|0|66|12|0|For the One who is most loving, wise and almighty, holds their reins in His hand.
CJ|0|66|13|0|Therefore, My Cyrenius, be without fear here with Me, and be assured that not a hair on anyone's head will be harmed!
CJ|0|66|14|0|These storms know exactly who is at home here.
CJ|0|66|15|0|See, this evening the people accorded fiery honors even to you, who are only a human being!
CJ|0|66|16|0|But here the storms honor Someone who is more than only a human being. Do you find that to be unreasonable?
CJ|0|66|17|0|See, that is a song of praise from nature, which honors its Creator! Is that not reasonable?
CJ|0|66|18|0|Oh Cyrenius, the air which wafts against you also understands Him who created it - that is why it can also praise Him!'
CJ|0|66|19|0|These words of the Baby, which soon slumbered again, brought all to silence and Cyrenius knelt down by the crib and secretly worshiped Him.
CJ|0|67|1|1|The Heathen Priests Demand A Sacrifice
CJ|0|67|1|0|A LESS VIOLENT HOUR went by, and no one was any longer too much concerned with the raging and blustering storm outside.
CJ|0|67|2|0|After an hour had passed, couriers came to Cyrenius in Joseph's house and reported, saying,
CJ|0|67|3|0|'High and mighty ruler! Unheard of things are taking place:
CJ|0|67|4|0|Fire breaks forth from the earth in several localities;
CJ|0|67|5|0|flying pillars of fire are driven back and forth by the hurricane and are destroying everything they come in contact with.
CJ|0|67|6|0|Nothing is solid and strong enough to withstand their terrible power.
CJ|0|67|7|0|The priests have said: The gods in their entirety have been provoked to anger and want to destroy us all! -
CJ|0|67|8|0|And it is truly so, for one can plainly hear the barking of Cerberus, and the furies are dancing about everywhere! Vulcan has directed his funnels to the upper earth,
CJ|0|67|9|0|while his Cyclops are wantonly destroying the houses and mountains.
CJ|0|67|10|0|And Neptune has united all his powers into one!
CJ|0|67|11|0|Like unto mountains he lifts the sea and wants to drown us all.
CJ|0|67|12|0|If great human sacrifices are not suddenly offered the extremely angered gods, we will all be destroyed!
CJ|0|67|13|0|The priests have determined upon a thousand youths and a thousand maidens for a sacrifice, and we are therefore dispatched to you in all haste that we should receive from you: the Fiat - the order: let it be done!'
CJ|0|67|14|0|Cyrenius was terribly startled at this news and just did not know what to do.
CJ|0|67|15|0|He hesitated to directly oppose the call from the priests for reasons of statecraft,
CJ|0|67|16|0|but to consent to the sacrifice was still more impossible to his heart than to contradict the priests.
CJ|0|67|17|0|He therefore turned to the Baby, who had just awakened, and asked His advice in this terrible matter.
CJ|0|67|18|0|And the Baby said, 'Be calm, for in one minute the storm will subside - and those who wanted to slaughter human beings are no more! Therefore be calm, My Cyrenius!'
CJ|0|68|1|1|The Martyrs Gain Time
CJ|0|68|1|0|IN THE MEANTIME the couriers were still waiting for the supreme command of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|68|2|0|Cyrenius now arose from the crib and said to the couriers,
CJ|0|68|3|0|'Go to the priests, and deliver to me the list of the youths and maidens intended for sacrifice,
CJ|0|68|4|0|for I must ascertain for myself whether the choice is just!'
CJ|0|68|5|0|At this the couriers hastened away while the storm had already come to a complete standstill.
CJ|0|68|6|0|But when they arrived in the city, they found to their horror that the palace which housed the priests had been transformed into a mighty heap of rubble, under which with the exception of three lesser priests all other higher priests had found their doom.
CJ|0|68|7|0|The couriers therefore soon turned back and brought the news of what had happened with the priests to Cyrenius.
CJ|0|68|8|0|Cyrenius, now fully convinced of the correctness of the Baby's declaration, did not know what to do next and again wanted to ask the Baby's advice.
CJ|0|68|9|0|But at that moment the three remaining lesser priests also came,
CJ|0|68|10|0|and hurriedly asked what was to be done, since a new earth-shock had buried all the devout servants of the gods in their palace while they were in fact equipped for the great sacrifice.
CJ|0|68|11|0|They stated that the thousand youths and the thousand maidens already stood prepared for the great sacrifice at the site where the pillar of Jupiter had been, which unfortunately was also fully destroyed.
CJ|0|68|12|0|Should the sacrifice be undertaken directly or only at sunrise?
CJ|0|68|13|0|In no case could the sacrifice be cancelled, since this could easily cause the gods to fall into still greater anger because of the ingratitude and the treachery of men!
CJ|0|68|14|0|Here Cyrenius answered the three lesser priests,
CJ|0|68|15|0|'The sacrifice may under no circumstances be undertaken today, and tomorrow morning under penalty of death only when I personally give the order for it!'
CJ|0|68|16|0|Thereupon the three lesser priests left Cyrenius and went to the site where the poor martyrs wept and lamented and in fear of death lifted their hands to the gods, begging that they might be spared.
CJ|0|68|17|0|And Cyrenius could hardly await the next morning, for he felt very sorry that the frightened martyrs had to endure such a night of terror.
CJ|0|69|1|1|The Sentence For The Priests
CJ|0|69|1|0|WHEN THE THREE lesser priests arrived at the place of sacrifice, they at once announced to the guards as well as to the poor young martyrs, who were overwhelmed by fear of death, that the determined-upon and irrevocable sacrifice would be carried out the following morning, and that with all the more certainty because the eminent Cyrenius himself had so ordered it.
CJ|0|69|2|0|What sort of an impression this news made on the two-thousand martyrs needs no elaboration for him who knows from historical tradition that such martyrs were tortured and killed in many ways to appease the different gods,
CJ|0|69|3|0|and that there were approximately a thousand forms of sacrifice.
CJ|0|69|4|0|Very early the next morning Cyrenius, Maronius and Joseph arose and went to the city.
CJ|0|69|5|0|It was an unusually clear morning as the three approached the determined-upon place of sacrifice.
CJ|0|69|6|0|While still some distance away, Cyrenius with the greatest bitterness of feeling already heard the terrible lament of the young people to be sacrificed.
CJ|0|69|7|0|He thereupon hastened his steps so he might put an end to this scene of horror as soon as possible.
CJ|0|69|8|0|When he arrived at the site, he was shocked at the inhuman feelings of the three lesser priests, who in greatest eagerness already awaited the command of Cyrenius to begin the slaughter.
CJ|0|69|9|0|Cyrenius immediately had the priests come to him and asked, 'Tell me, are you not at all sorry for this glorious youth, since they are to be murdered in a most cruel fashion? Have you no sympathy for them in your hearts?'
CJ|0|69|10|0|And the priests declared, 'Where the gods have feelings, there is an end to human sympathy!
CJ|0|69|11|0|The life of men is nothing to the gods - and often only an abomination; hence this disposes our feelings as their servants on earth to be like unto theirs and we can have no compassion in us,
CJ|0|69|12|0|but only an ecstasy and a rejoicing because we are able to serve the gods punctually!
CJ|0|69|13|0|Consequently we are in fact looking forward with exceeding joy to the slaughter of these by the high gods anyhow seldom required sacrifices!'
CJ|0|69|14|0|This declaration gave Cyrenius such a great jolt in his heart that he began to tremble from wrath at these priests.
CJ|0|69|15|0|But he soon regained his composure and again asked the priests, 'But how would it be, if Zeus himself were here and granted these martyrs their lives? - What would you do then?'
CJ|0|69|16|0|The priests answered, 'Then the sacrifice would have to be undertaken with all the more certainty, because that would only be a test of our priestly zealousness to serve!
CJ|0|69|17|0|If we then were to take pity on the destined martyrs, Zeus would look upon us as blasphemers and destroy us with thunder and lightning!'
CJ|0|69|18|0|At this Cyrenius continued to question the priests, saying, 'What then have the other high priests committed before the gods, in that they were so miserably killed in their palace?'
CJ|0|69|19|0|Here the priests answered, 'Do you not know that above all the gods and their priests there reigns an inexorable Destiny?
CJ|0|69|20|0|It has killed the priests, as It has excited the gods before that. Now the gods It cannot kill, but only the here and there still mortal priests!'
CJ|0|69|21|0|'Good,' retorted Cyrenius, 'Last night past midnight Destiny came to me and gave me the command to grant all these young people their lives - and to sacrifice you instead, and that as surely as my name is Cyrenius and my brother Julius Augustus Caesar reigns as first consul and emperor in Rome! - Now what do you say to these tidings?'
CJ|0|69|22|0|These dread tidings caused the priests to turn pale and brought the other martyrs back to their senses. And Cyrenius immediately had all of the martyrs spoken free, but the three priests bound and prepared for execution.
CJ|0|70|1|1|The Law Of Sacrifice
CJ|0|70|1|0|JOSEPH NOW went over to Cyrenius and asked him, 'Highly honored and very dear friend, are you unalterably determined to have these three idolatrous priests killed?'
CJ|0|70|2|0|And Cyrenius, filled with wrath toward these three utterly heartless human tigers, answered Joseph,
CJ|0|70|3|0|'Yes, my highly esteemed friend! Here I will set up an example by which all the people shall know that I avenge nothing so severely as the utter lack of human kindness!
CJ|0|70|4|0|For a person without love and without any feeling of sympathy is the greatest evil on the face of the earth.
CJ|0|70|5|0|All rending animals are lambs, and the furies of hell are hardly poor students compared to him.
CJ|0|70|6|0|I therefore consider it to be the indeed first and foremost duty of a true ruler of the people to root out such monsters and to completely exterminate them from the face of the earth.
CJ|0|70|7|0|The priests should make it their first duty to especially instruct the people in charity. They should set a good example for everyone!
CJ|0|70|8|0|But when these principal teachers and leaders of the people become furies, what then shall become of their students?
CJ|0|70|9|0|Therefore away with such brutes! I am only considering the most tormenting manner of death now - once I have it, the staff shall immediately be broken over them.'
CJ|0|70|10|0|Joseph hardly dared to make any objections to Cyrenius, for he had spoken these words with the greatest determination.
CJ|0|70|11|0|After a while the three priests fell down before Cyrenius and entreated him for mercy with the assurance that they would unfailingly change their way of life and were also ready to lay down their priesthood on the spot.
CJ|0|70|12|0|To gain grace they appealed to the law of the priests, which had caused them to act thus and not otherwise.
CJ|0|70|13|0|Here Cyrenius retorted, 'Do you rascals suppose that I am not familiar with the laws of the priests?
CJ|0|70|14|0|Listen, the special law of sacrifice reads thus: If any people have obviously become unfaithful to the gods by their excesses and the gods visit them with war, hunger and pestilence, the priests should then warn the people to better their ways.
CJ|0|70|15|0|If the people take heed, the priests should again bless them and, to reconcile the gods, lay upon the people the duty of bringing certain sacrifices of gold, cattle and grain before the priests, so these can dedicate the sacrifice and make a smoke offering with it.
CJ|0|70|16|0|But if there should be such a stubborn, unconvertable people which mocked the priests, then the priests should have the mockers as well as their children seized and instructed with the whip in subterranean chambers seven months long.
CJ|0|70|17|0|'If the blasphemers repent, they shall again be given their freedom, but if they do not repent, they shall fall by the sword - and then only be paid in the flame as an atonement to the gods. -
CJ|0|70|18|0|Does the wise old law of sacrifices not read thus? - Was there war, hunger and pestilence here? Was this beautiful youth faithless to the gods? Did you first instruct them for seven months? - No, instead you wanted to kill them out of ambition and lust! And therefore you must die as the greatest blasphemers against your own law!'
CJ|0|71|1|1|Vengeance Belongs To The Lord Alone
CJ|0|71|1|0|AFTER THIS declaration of Cyrenius, Joseph again went over to him and said:
CJ|0|71|2|0|'Cyrenius, my highly esteemed friend and brother! I think that you should leave the punishment of these three idolatrous priests, who are apparently creatures of ill-will, to the Lord!
CJ|0|71|3|0|Believe me, no one performs an agreeable service to the Lord, the almighty God of heaven and earth, by taking a life, not even when he has the greatest malefactor executed.
CJ|0|71|4|0|Do therefore without any qualms leave the just chastisement of these three to the Almighty, and the Lord will bless you by means of the punishment which He will very surely visit upon these three, unless they undertake a very great penance and make a complete about face!'
CJ|0|71|5|0|But if, within themselves, they adopt true penitence and return to the only true God, they can still also become noble men!
CJ|0|71|6|0|These words of Joseph caused Cyrenius to consider just what he should actually do.
CJ|0|71|7|0|After a while he decided to at least expose the three to a strong fear of death in reprisal for the fear which they caused the poor young people.
CJ|0|71|8|0|He therefore said to Joseph, 'My closest and highly honored friend and brother! I have well weighed your counsel and shall also heed it!
CJ|0|71|9|0|But at the present moment I just cannot do that. I must follow through by breaking the threatened staff before these wicked servants and condemn them to a most painful death.
CJ|0|71|10|0|Once they have suffered a twenty-four-hour-long fear of death, then do you loudly entreat me before all the people at this execution site for mercy and the lifting of the death penalty,
CJ|0|71|11|0|and I shall manifestly grant your request and then after the order of the law let these three rascals off with their lives!
CJ|0|71|12|0|I believe that is best, for I just cannot pardon them right away because I have discerned them to be gross offenders against the law of the priests.
CJ|0|71|13|0|According to the law they must hear the death sentence. Once that is done, then only in extraordinary cases can the pardon take the place of the execution of the sentence.
CJ|0|71|14|0|And now I shall fulfill this task at once!'
CJ|0|71|15|0|Joseph agreed to this, and Cyrenius immediately called the judges, the carriers of the staves (lictores) and the jailers over and declared,
CJ|0|71|16|0|'Bring three iron crosses and chains! Set the crosses firmly into the ground and maintain a fire around the erected crosses for twenty-four hours!
CJ|0|71|17|0|Once these have reached the proper red-heat, I shall arrive and have the three blasphemers hoisted upon the red-hot crosses! Fiat!'
CJ|0|71|18|0|Thereupon Cyrenius took a staff, broke it, threw it under the feet of the three and asserted,
CJ|0|71|19|0|'Now you have heard your sentence. So make yourselves ready, for you deserve such a death! Fiat!'
CJ|0|71|20|0|This sentence had the effect of a thousand bolts of lightning on the three. They immediately began to weep and wail and to call upon all the gods for help.
CJ|0|71|21|0|Then they were promptly put under close guard, and the jailers went directly to the jail and brought the designated instruments of torture. And Cyrenius, Joseph and Maronius promptly returned to the villa.
CJ|0|72|1|1|The Lion Of Judah
CJ|0|72|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS with Joseph and Maronius Pilla approached the villa, Mary with the Child in her arms went to meet the three in anxious concern and quickly asked Joseph,
CJ|0|72|2|0|'Joseph, my dearly beloved husband! Oh tell me, what happened to the young people?
CJ|0|72|3|0|For if such sacrifices always take place here because of the not infrequent occurrence of such elemental storms, then we are not safe either with our Child!
CJ|0|72|4|0|For while He has great power - we still had to flee Palestine before Herod despite this power,
CJ|0|72|5|0|from which I have concluded that in certain instances the Child still has too little power! Therefore it is our responsibility to remove Him from all great dangers!'
CJ|0|72|6|0|Joseph answered Mary, 'My by the Lord Himself to me espoused wife, have no fear on that account!
CJ|0|72|7|0|Behold, not a hair of the young people so ignominiously intended for sacrifice has been touched!
CJ|0|72|8|0|Our dear Cyrenius has promptly given them their freedom and in their stead condemned the three priests who were here yesterday and requested his permission for the slaughter of these young people. The priests are now condemned to a most excruciating death on red-hot iron crosses!
CJ|0|72|9|0|But - among ourselves - only seemingly. Tomorrow morning, instead of the fulfillment of the death sentence, they shall obtain a pardon!
CJ|0|72|10|0|And this rebuke will certainly serve them as a thorough warning, by means of which they surely will no more suggest any such sacrifice to idols.
CJ|0|72|11|0|Therefore, my dearly beloved wife, be wholly without fear and consider: The Lord, who has led us so safely up to now, will neither deliver us up to the power of the heathen in the future.'
CJ|0|72|12|0|These words put Mary completely at ease and her mien regained its cheerfulness.
CJ|0|72|13|0|Here the Baby smiled into the mother's face and said,
CJ|0|72|14|0|'Mary, if someone had tamed a lion in such a manner that the lion carried him about like a gentle beast of burden,
CJ|0|72|15|0|do you suppose that it would be praiseworthy of him while, astride the mighty back of the lion to be afraid of the flighty rabbit?'
CJ|0|72|16|0|Mary was astonished at the deep wisdom of these words, but she did not understand them.
CJ|0|72|17|0|And the Baby again said to Mary, and that with quite a serious mien:
CJ|0|72|18|0|'I am the mighty Lion of Judah who carries you upon His back. How then can you fear those whom I can scatter like loose chaff?
CJ|0|72|19|0|Do you really suppose that I fled before Herod to protect Myself from his wrath?
CJ|0|72|20|0|Oh no! I only fled to spare him, for if My countenance had beheld him he would have been lost forever! -
CJ|0|72|21|0|See, the dear little children who were slaughtered for Me are already happy beyond measure in My kingdom - they are around Me daily and even now perfectly know Me as their Lord forever!
CJ|0|72|22|0|See, Mary, that is the way matters stand. And that is why you should be silent about Me wherever you are, as you were warned. But you may well know for yourself who He is whom you shall call: the Son of God and also did call Him that!'
CJ|0|72|23|0|These words made Mary quake through and through - for she now fully realized that she was carrying the Lord on her arms.
CJ|0|72|24|0|But also Maronius, who was behind Mary, heard the words of the Child and fell down before Him.
CJ|0|72|25|0|It was only now that Cyrenius discovered Mary's presence, for until now he was engaged in conversation with one of his accompanying secretaries.
CJ|0|72|26|0|He therefore suddenly hurried over to the Child and kissed and caressed Him, while the Baby did the same and then said, 'Cyrenius, raise up Maronius - for he is now prepared. Now he may recognize Me! - Do you understand what I am saying therewith?'
CJ|0|73|1|1|The Baby's Dictum To Cyrenius
CJ|0|73|1|0|WHEN THEY ALL had arrived at the villa, Cyrenius immediately sent his adjutant into the city to the garrison commander and informed him that on this and the following day no parades nor marches from the city were to take place.
CJ|0|73|2|0|For such was the custom with the Romans on extraordinary occasions that with certain phenomena - as perhaps an eclipse of the sun or moon, a violent storm,
CJ|0|73|3|0|fiery meteors, comets, the sudden appearance of an insane person, an epileptic seizure,
CJ|0|73|4|0|as well as extraordinary days of execution - all these by custom did not permit the Romans to also deal with ordinary matters of the state.
CJ|0|73|5|0|For all such days were considered by the otherwise in many ways realistic Romans as days of misfortune or as special days of the gods, which the people were to keep holy at the first opportunity and were not to make use of them for their personal business.
CJ|0|73|6|0|While Cyrenius did not take much stock in these empty customs by himself, he had to observe them because of the populace which still adhered firmly to such follies.
CJ|0|73|7|0|When the adjutant had departed, Cyrenius said to Joseph, 'Esteemed friend and brother! Have a breakfast prepared now. After breakfast we will all go into the city together and there view the ravages of the storm.
CJ|0|73|8|0|On this occasion we will undoubtedly find many citizens of this locality who are poor and were struck by misfortune, to whom we shall give aid in every possible way.
CJ|0|73|9|0|Then we will inspect the harbor and see what condition the ships are in and if and to what extent they were damaged.
CJ|0|73|10|0|No doubt a number of tasks will arise for your sons, whom I will immediately name as first overseers, since this city especially has a very great lack of builders.
CJ|0|73|11|0|For Egypt, from the architectural point of View, is now far inferior to what it was a thousand years ago at the times of the old Pharaohs.'
CJ|0|73|12|0|Joseph immediately acted on the wish of Cyrenius and had a simple breakfast prepared consisting of bread, honey and milk and a few fruits.
CJ|0|73|13|0|After the meal Cyrenius and all the table guests arose and wanted to go into the city according to his intention.
CJ|0|73|14|0|But the Baby called Cyrenius to himself and said to him: 'My Cyrenius, you are going into the city to help the suffering citizenry in any way you can, and your greatest desire is to have Me with you.
CJ|0|73|15|0|Yes, I will also go with you, but you must hear Me and follow My advice!
CJ|0|73|16|0|See, those who are suffering the most are surely those three who were condemned by you to a twenty-four-hour fear of death.
CJ|0|73|17|0|Now mark, I am not pleased with the too great suffering of these who are wretched - so we will first go there and help these most miserable souls. Only after that we will visit the lesser unfortunates in the city and the seaharbor.
CJ|0|73|18|0|If you will do that, I shall go with you, but if you will not, I shall stay at home. See, I am also a Master in My own way and can do as I please without relying on you. But if you do take My advice, I will surely rely on you.'
CJ|0|74|1|1|The Pardon Of The Priests
CJ|0|74|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS heard this from the to him above all exalted little Cradle-Orator, as he sometimes called Him, he hesitated within himself and did not know just what to do.
CJ|0|74|2|0|For on the one hand he felt himself to be too greatly exposed before the people as an inconsistent commander-in-chief and supreme governor,
CJ|0|74|3|0|but for all that he just had too much respect for the tried and tested power of the Child.
CJ|0|74|4|0|For a while he thought back and forth and then said to himself,
CJ|0|74|5|0|'Oh Scylla, oh Charybdis, oh myth of Hercules at the crossroads!
CJ|0|74|6|0|Here the hero stands between two chasms; if he avoids the one, he plunges inevitably into the other!
CJ|0|74|7|0|What shall I do now? Where shall I turn? Shall I for the first time appear inconsistent before the people and do the will of this mighty Child?
CJ|0|74|8|0|Or shall I act according to my own anyhow very mild decision?'
CJ|0|74|9|0|Here the Baby again called Cyrenius to Himself and smilingly said, 'My dear friend, you concern yourself vainly over nothing!
CJ|0|74|10|0|What is Scylla and what Charybdis and what the hero Hercules before me? You follow Me, and you will not have to deal with these transitory things!'
CJ|0|74|11|0|And Cyrenius, recovering from his indecision, said to the Child,
CJ|0|74|12|0|'Yes, my Life, my little Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in the cradle, You I will please let come what may!
CJ|0|74|13|0|So then let us go to the place of execution and there promptly transform our sentence into mercy!'
CJ|0|74|14|0|At this Maronius also approached Cyrenius and said to him in an aside,
CJ|0|74|15|0|'Imperial, consular highness! I am quite in agreement with the advice of the Child. For it has just come into my mind that the death penalty in priestly matters may never be inflicted on the priests without the sanction of the Pontifex maximus in Rome -
CJ|0|74|16|0|unless they were instigators to revolt against the state, which these here are not, but only blind zealots in their cause.
CJ|0|74|17|0|Therefore I am altogether for the advice of the Child. To comply with it can only be to your advantage and can never give you a setback.'
CJ|0|74|18|0|Cyrenius was pleased at this observation of Maronius and therefore went on his way at once with all who were to accompany him.
CJ|0|74|19|0|Arrived at the place of execution, he found the three priests almost lifeless - from too great fear of a most excruciating death.
CJ|0|74|20|0|Only one of them still had enough presence of mind to lift himself up before Cyrenius with the greatest difficulty and entreat him for a merciful manner of death.
CJ|0|74|21|0|And Cyrenius said to him as well as to the other two, 'Look at the Child whom this mother carries upon her arms. He give you back your life, and thus I also grant it to you and recall my sentence.
CJ|0|74|22|0|Therefore arise again and walk at liberty. Fiat! And you guards, judges, carriers of the staves and jailers, depart with everything. Fiat!'
CJ|0|74|23|0|This declaration of grace cost the three priests their lives - but the Baby stretched a hand over the three and they came back to life and in a happy frame of mind promptly followed the little Savior of their lives.
CJ|0|75|1|1|The Sword Justified As A Shepherd's Staff
CJ|0|75|1|0|QUICKLY LEAVING the place of judgment, the entire group now made its way into the city, accompanied by the three pardoned priests.
CJ|0|75|2|0|When the group arrived in the city at the great square and saw the mighty heap of rubble of the great temple and of the entire, still greater palace of the priests,
CJ|0|75|3|0|Cyrenius clapped his hands together above his head and exclaimed in a loud voice,
CJ|0|75|4|0|'What an enormous change! Yes, only the power of a God can manifest itself like this!
CJ|0|75|5|0|Long periods of time are not needed, but only a nod of the Omnipotence suffices to transform the entire circle of the earth into dust.
CJ|0|75|6|0|Oh men of earth, would you fight Him who commands the elements and they obey His nod?
CJ|0|75|7|0|Would you be judge where the Deity's omnipotence commands, and rule where a slight nod of the Eternal Ruler crushes you to dust?
CJ|0|75|8|0|No, no! I am a fool that I still carry my sword girded about me as if I had any power!
CJ|0|75|9|0|Away, you wretched trappings! Here in this heap of rubble is the best place for you. And my true sword shall be You, whom the mother carries upon her arms.'
CJ|0|75|10|0|Here Cyrenius suddenly loosed his sword and his belt of honor from his body and vehemently wanted to hurl them into the heap of rubble.
CJ|0|75|11|0|But the Baby, who was present at Cyrenius' side on Mary's arms, admonished him:
CJ|0|75|12|0|'Cyrenius! That you must not do! For truly, whoever carries the sword after your manner carries it justly.
CJ|0|75|13|0|Let him who uses the sword as a weapon cast it from him - but whoever uses it as a shepherd's staff, let him keep it.
CJ|0|75|14|0|For thus is the will of Him whom heaven and earth must eternally obey!
CJ|0|75|15|0|Now you are a shepherd to those who are written in the book of your sword,
CJ|0|75|16|0|so gird yourself again now with just honor, that your people will know you as its shepherd.
CJ|0|75|17|0|If your flock consisted solely of lambs, then you would require no staff.
CJ|0|75|18|0|But among it there are very many rams, therefore I would rather add another staff to you than to take the one from you!
CJ|0|75|19|0|It is indeed true: apart from God there is no power, but when God bestows power upon you, then you should not cast it from you into that which is under God's judgment!'
CJ|0|75|20|0|These words moved Cyrenius to immediately regird the sword while he constantly worshiped the Baby in silence. And the three priests were amazed beyond measure at the wisdom of this little Child.
CJ|0|76|1|1|The True Mythology Of The Gods
CJ|0|76|1|0|WITH THE GREATEST esteem the three priests approached Joseph and asked him how this Child had come to such a most amazing wisdom, and how old He already was.
CJ|0|76|2|0|Joseph answered them, 'Dear friends, do not ask about that too soon, for a too premature answer could cost you your lives!
CJ|0|76|3|0|But follow us and drop your many gods, believe that there is only one true God of heaven and of earth, and believe that this one true God is the same whom the people of Israel worship and honor at Jerusalem, and you will find out within yourselves and from  this Child whence His wisdom is!'
CJ|0|76|4|0|Here the priests asked, 'Sir, you speak strange words here!
CJ|0|76|5|0|Are then our main gods, Zeus, Apollo, Mercury, Vulcan, Pluto, Mars and Neptune, Juno, Minerva, Venus and others nothing more than mere creations of human fancy?'
CJ|0|76|6|0|And Joseph answered: 'Listen to me, friends! All of your gods came into being by the imagination of your forefathers at a time when they still knew the one God very well.
CJ|0|76|7|0|These were rare poets and singers in the courts of the old kings of this land and personified the characteristics of the one true God in apt analogies.
CJ|0|76|8|0|To them Jupiter represented the grace and love of the Father from eternity, while Apollo portrayed the wisdom of the Father, and Minerva the power of this wisdom.
CJ|0|76|9|0|Mercury signified the presence everywhere of the one God by His almighty will.
CJ|0|76|10|0|Venus portrayed the glory and beauty and eternally constant youth of the Deity.
CJ|0|76|11|0|Vulcan and Pluto represented the one God's absolute power over the whole earth.
CJ|0|76|12|0|Mars depicted the divine earnestness, judgment and death for the condemned.
CJ|0|76|13|0|Neptune represented the spirit of the one God active in all waters and how He gives life to the earth through these waters.
CJ|0|76|14|0|Thus the old Isis and also Osiris signified the divine, inviolably Holiness, which is divine love and wisdom from all eternity in Itself.
CJ|0|76|15|0|And thus all the other gods portrayed nothing but the various attributes of the one God in analogous pictures!
CJ|0|76|16|0|That was a highly praiseworthy illustration, for it entered no one's mind but that all of this signified only the one God in the diverse and infinite manner of His modus operandi.
CJ|0|76|17|0|But in time selfishness, self-love and lust for power deluded and obscured the light in mankind.
CJ|0|76|18|0|They lost the spirit and nothing remained for them than the outward form and they became pagans, which means the same as: they became coarse materialists, lost the one God and therefore gnawed on outer, empty and uncomprehended pictures like dogs which in their hunger gnaw on bones on which there is no more meat. - Do you understand me?'
CJ|0|76|19|0|Here the three made big eyes at each other and replied, 'Truly, you are better versed in our religion than we are! But where did you learn all this?'
CJ|0|76|20|0|And Joseph replied, 'Just be patient; the Child will reveal it to you. So follow us and do not fall back again.'
CJ|0|77|1|1|The Reawakening Of The Seven Guides
CJ|0|77|1|0|THE THREE PRIESTS now asked no more, for they recognized in Joseph a man who seemed to be deeply initiated into the old mysteries of Egypt which otherwise were known only to the chief priests of this land.
CJ|0|77|2|0|Cyrenius then turned to the three priests and asked them how many of their number had lost their lives here.
CJ|0|77|3|0|And the three said, 'Most powerful governor, we cannot give the number exactly,
CJ|0|77|4|0|but there certainly were more than seven hundred which were buried, without counting the novices of both sexes.'
CJ|0|77|5|0|'Good,' observed Cyrenius, 'we shall soon inform ourselves more closely in the matter.'
CJ|0|77|6|0|He thereupon asked Joseph if it were not advisable to dig out those buried in the rubble.
CJ|0|77|7|0|Joseph answered, 'That is even a strict duty, for some novices could still be alive here and there in the catacombs, and to save these is a strict duty.'
CJ|0|77|8|0|When Cyrenius heard this he immediately had two thousand laborers called, who promptly began removing the debris.
CJ|0|77|9|0|In a few hours seven corpses were pulled out, which were none other than the guides to the catacombs.
CJ|0|77|10|0|Thereupon Cyrenius said, 'Truly, I am sorry about these, for without their help we will not accomplish much in the subterranean labyrinth of countless passages upon passages.'
CJ|0|77|11|0|Here the Baby said to Cyrenius, 'My Cyrenius, as concerns the catacombs, nothing of much use is to be found in them,
CJ|0|77|12|0|for they lie unused for several hundred years and are filled with mud and all manner of vermin.
CJ|0|77|13|0|These seven guides to the catacombs merely had the empty title as such, for not one of them ever set foot in a catacomb.
CJ|0|77|14|0|And now, so you may believe what I am telling you, I will also tell you that these seven guides are not quite dead but lie there in a great stupor and can therefore be recalled to life.
CJ|0|77|15|0|Have them massaged about their temples, chest, neck, hands and feet by robust women, and they will soon awaken from their stupor.'
CJ|0|77|16|0|At this Cyrenius asked the Baby, 'O my Life! If You were to touch them, they surely would also awaken.'
CJ|0|77|17|0|And the Baby answered, 'Do what I have advised you, for I must not do too much if I do not want to bring a judgment instead of a blessing to the world.'
CJ|0|77|18|0|Cyrenius did not understand these words, but he nevertheless followed the advice of the Baby.
CJ|0|77|19|0|He immediately had ten robust maidens brought so they might massage the seven guides.
CJ|0|77|20|0|After a few minutes the seven awoke and asked the bystanders what had happened to them and what was taking place.
CJ|0|77|21|0|Hereupon Cyrenius promptly had them taken to a good inn, while the people were greatly surprised at this awakening and accorded the maidens great respect.
CJ|0|78|1|1|The Strange Effects Of The Earthquake
CJ|0|78|1|0|AFTER THIS the digging continued, and Cyrenius gave the order that all corpses which were not too greatly mutilated should be laid face downward at a designated place which was covered with mats.
CJ|0|78|2|0|Only the greatly mutilated corpses were to be either cremated at once or buried eight feet deep in the common burial place.
CJ|0|78|3|0|With the less mutilated corpses similar attempts to restore them to life should be made as was done with the seven,
CJ|0|78|4|0|and those restored to life were promptly to be brought into the inn to the seven others.
CJ|0|78|5|0|When he had given this order, Cyrenius, accompanied by Joseph, left with his aides to inspect other parts of the city.
CJ|0|78|6|0|And he found to his great surprise that nowhere was there a citizen's house damaged in the least,
CJ|0|78|7|0|while on the other hand not a temple of the gods was to be found anywhere which did not lay in ruins, with the exception of a single little temple which was locked and bore the inscription, "To the unknown God".
CJ|0|78|8|0|When the group along with a great following of the people had thus wandered through the whole, not unimportant little city of eighty thousand inhabitants, Cyrenius asked Joseph to come over and said to him,
CJ|0|78|9|0|'Listen, my highly esteemed friend and brother, I simply have to laugh to myself because of the peculiar effect of the earthquake as well as that of the storm.
CJ|0|78|10|0|Now just look over here! Along this lane in front of us stand houses of the most wretched type of construction; dry stones are laid one above the other without mortar - and rather unsymmetrically at that - to make a wall.
CJ|0|78|11|0|One would suppose that they are hardly solid enough to withstand the shock caused by the hoof of a horse that has any more than average weight.
CJ|0|78|12|0|But look, these veritable ant structures stand unharmed! Not one is damaged even in the least,
CJ|0|78|13|0|while right among these truly from-today-until-tomorrow-houses the temples, solidly built to last for thousands of years, are all rubble!
CJ|0|78|14|0|What do you think of this truly strange phenomenon? Is it not obvious here that the earthquake as well as the storm must have gone about their work very intelligently?
CJ|0|78|15|0|Truly, to my great joy I must confess to you and say,
CJ|0|78|16|0|If your little Son with His almighty fingers did not play a little among the temples in company with the storm, my name is not Cyrenius!'
CJ|0|78|17|0|Here Joseph said, 'Keep what you believe wholly to yourself and be sure to speak to no one about it - for it would certainly seem to be so!
CJ|0|78|18|0|Now let us now go to the harbor and see if there is anything to do for me there.' - and Cyrenius promptly followed Joseph's advice and went down to the sea-shore.
CJ|0|79|1|1|A Judgment Is Avoided
CJ|0|79|1|0|ONCE THE PARTY arrived at the sea-shore, where the harbor was constructed partly by nature and partly by the artifice of men, Cyrenius again was considerably surprised.
CJ|0|79|2|0|For nowhere was any damage to be seen, except that all the mythological decorations on the pretentious ship of Cyrenius were as good as destroyed.
CJ|0|79|3|0|At this Cyrenius said to Joseph, 'My very esteemed friend, under these circumstances your sons will have little to do.
CJ|0|79|4|0|See, not one vessel has received any other damage than that - which is quite welcome to me - the idols have apparently been cast into the water, especially from my ship,
CJ|0|79|5|0|with which I am indeed highly pleased for I certainly shall not have any more placed anywhere on my ship.
CJ|0|79|6|0|All praise, all honor to your God for that!
CJ|0|79|7|0|But for all that I shall so reward your sons for eventual little repairs, which will have to be done here and there on the ships, as if they had done something big.'
CJ|0|79|8|0|Here Joseph said to Cyrenius, 'Oh friend and brother, do not overly concern yourself with the earnings of my children.
CJ|0|79|9|0|See, not because of the earnings, but just to render you a good service I would gladly have come to your aid in such a matter of carpentry. But the Lord has helped you and it is better that way, for now you can easily do without my help.
CJ|0|79|10|0|Now that we have seen everything and since it is already rather late in the afternoon, I suggest that we go home again and wait until tomorrow to look at anything that may still remain.'
CJ|0|79|11|0|Cyrenius agreed, 'That is what I think, for I am very sorry indeed for the poor mother, so we must see to it now that we get home as soon as possible!
CJ|0|79|12|0|I shall have a litter brought for her at once, so she may be carried home with the Baby.'
CJ|0|79|13|0|Here the Baby immediately made His presence known in back of Cyrenius and said to him:
CJ|0|79|14|0|'Be sure to do that, for the said mother has already become very tired, since she had a heavy burden to carry in Me.
CJ|0|79|15|0|But on the way home you must not follow your intention to make your way across that certain square of the priests.
CJ|0|79|16|0|For if My mother were to carry Me past there, where by now about one-hundred of those buried in the rubble are lying upon mats,
CJ|0|79|17|0|they all would suddenly return to life, and that would be a judgment for you and all the people which would do great harm to everyone concerned.
CJ|0|79|18|0|But this way they will be awakened throughout the night by means of human assistance under My secret influence.
CJ|0|79|19|0|In this manner the appearance of the miraculous will be avoided, and you and all the people will be spared from a judgment that kills the spirit forever!'
CJ|0|79|20|0|Cyrenius closely followed this advice, greatly gladdened in his heart. The litter was instantly provided, and Mary with the Baby took place in the same.
CJ|0|79|21|0|And Cyrenius chose another route, by which the whole company including the three priests quite soon and very comfortably reached the villa of Joseph.
CJ|0|80|1|1|The Lord Pinches Those Who Love Him
CJ|0|80|1|0|WHEN HE ARRIVED at the villa, Joseph went directly to his sons who just then were busy with the preparation of a noon meal and said to them,
CJ|0|80|2|0|'Good, good, my sons, you have anticipated my wish, but today we have three more guests, namely the three priests who early today were set out to die!
CJ|0|80|3|0|These we want to treat exceptionally well, so they will become our friends in the recognition of our Father in heaven,
CJ|0|80|4|0|who has chosen us to be His children through the covenant which He made with our fathers.
CJ|0|80|5|0|You, James, go outside quickly to meet the mother who has become very tired and relieve her of the Baby dearest to us all,
CJ|0|80|6|0|and put Him to bed right away, for He also is noticeably tired and yearns for His cradle!'
CJ|0|80|7|0|James immediately ran out and went over to Mary who was just getting out of the litter, and at once with great love and joy took the Baby from her arms.
CJ|0|80|8|0|The Baby also returned the same great affection to James - for He frisked about on his arms and smiled and pinched and pulled on him as much as ever He could get hold of him with His little hands.
CJ|0|80|9|0|And the three priests, who were filled with the utmost respect of this Child, were surprised and delighted in their souls because they discovered something quite childlike in this Child.
CJ|0|80|10|0|One of them therefore went over to James and asked him in good Hebrew,
CJ|0|80|11|0|'Tell me, is this most miraculous Child of all children always so hearty, yes one might say even a bit teasingly rough like ordinary children sometimes are, although not until they are two or three years old?'
CJ|0|80|12|0|Here the Baby promptly answered in place of James, saying:
CJ|0|80|13|0|'Yes, yes, My friend! Those I love, I also pinch, squeeze and tease - but that happens only with those who love Me as My James does - and I love them as I love My dear James here.
CJ|0|80|14|0|But I do not do them any harm for all that! - Is it not so, My dear James, it does not hurt you if I pinch and squeeze you?'
CJ|0|80|15|0|At this James, quickly touched to tears as usual, said, 'Oh my divine, dearest little Brother, how could You hurt me?'
CJ|0|80|16|0|And the Baby thereupon answered James, saying: 'James, My brother, you do truly love me!
CJ|0|80|17|0|And I love you so much that you will eternally never be able to quite comprehend how much I love you!
CJ|0|80|18|0|See, my dear brother James, the heavens are wide and infinitely great - they include countless numbers of shining worlds of light in relation to which the earth is only a drop of dew -
CJ|0|80|19|0|and these worlds carry countless numbers of most happy beings of your kind. But among them none is happier than you, now My dearest brother! At present you do not understand Me, but in time you will understand Me quite well. I do not want to sleep now while the children of men keep watch about Me. And with you, James, I shall remain!
CJ|0|80|20|0|These words broke James' heart anew and he wept for joy of love, and the inquiring priest nearly sank into the ground from sheer reverence and highest respect for this Child.
CJ|0|81|1|1|A Great Prophecy For Rome
CJ|0|81|1|0|CYRENIUS, who had also heard these words of the Baby quite well, instantly went over to the Baby and asked Him in a most loving manner, 'Oh my Life!
CJ|0|81|2|0|Then You surely do not love me as much, for when I had You on my arms You never pinched and squeezed me?'
CJ|0|81|3|0|Here the Baby answered, 'Cyrenius, do not be concerned about that - behold, all the troubles which you have already endured for My sake were just so many pinches and squeezes by Me because I love you so greatly!
CJ|0|81|4|0|Now do you understand what I have told you?
CJ|0|81|5|0|For I shall indeed pinch and squeeze you still often enough - and from sheer love of you will be quite rough.
CJ|0|81|6|0|But listen, you must not be afraid of Me because of that, for no harm will come to you by it, just as has been the case up to now. Do you understand me, My dear Cyrenius?'
CJ|0|81|7|0|And Cyrenius, while filled in his heart with the greatest respect of the Child, said in a greatly crestfallen manner,
CJ|0|81|8|0|'Yes, yes, my Life! I understand You very well and know what great thing You have told me.
CJ|0|81|9|0|But just the same I still would also like to have You pinch and squeeze me a little just as You do with Your brother.'
CJ|0|81|10|0|And the Baby said to Cyrenius: 'Oh My dear friend, you surely are not going to be more childish than I am?
CJ|0|81|11|0|Do you really believe that I would love you more because of that?
CJ|0|81|12|0|Oh see, in that you are greatly mistaken, for I could not possibly love you more than I already love you.
CJ|0|81|13|0|Truly, you will eternally never be able to wholly comprehend nor fathom the magnitude and depth of My love for you!
CJ|0|81|14|0|Mark it well, less than a century will go by when Rome will take possession of My citadel in great numbers.
CJ|0|81|15|0|And while this time is still to come, I can assure you that you already stand on the threshold which will soon be tread by many.
CJ|0|81|16|0|But understand - not in the body, but in the spirit in My future kingdom forever!
CJ|0|81|17|0|These words of the Child caused a great sensation among all those present, and Cyrenius did not know what to make of it.
CJ|0|81|18|0|He therefore turned to the bystanding Mary and asked her if she understood what the divine Child had now foretold.
CJ|0|81|19|0|And Mary said, 'Oh friend, if This were an ordinary human being we human beings would also understand Him,
CJ|0|81|20|0|but because He is of a higher nature, we are unable to understand Him! So let us keep all of His words within ourselves, for in time they will surely be revealed to us in their true light.'
CJ|0|82|1|1|Here Is More Than Isis
CJ|0|82|1|0|JOSEPH NOW came out of the villa and invited the guests to the already prepared meal.
CJ|0|82|2|0|Hereupon Cyrenius, filled with conflicting great thoughts, asked Joseph to come over to him and told him what the Baby and then Mary had just said,
CJ|0|82|3|0|and asked the good Joseph how this sort of speech were to be understood.
CJ|0|82|4|0|And Joseph replied to the a little too disturbed Cyrenius, saying,
CJ|0|82|5|0|'Oh friend and brother, are you not familiar with the myth which tells of the man who once wanted to lift the mantle of Isis?'
CJ|0|82|6|0|Cyrenius, quite surprised at this unexpected question, said,
CJ|0|82|7|0|'Oh noble friend, that myth is well known to me - the man perished miserably! But what do you want to tell me therewith in answer to my question?'
CJ|0|82|8|0|Here Joseph answered Cyrenius, 'Beloved friend, nothing else than: Here is more than Isis!
CJ|0|82|9|0|Therefore follow the advice of my wife, and you will fare eternally well!'
CJ|0|82|10|0|Maronius Pilla also stood close-by and said on this occasion,
CJ|0|82|11|0|'Consular, imperial highness! I know that I am usually quite stupid in such matters, but this time it seems to me as if I understood the wise man perfectly.'
CJ|0|82|12|0|Cyrenius answered him, 'Good for you, if you are convinced of that within yourself,
CJ|0|82|13|0|but I cannot make that claim for myself just now.
CJ|0|82|14|0|Usually my brain is not held completely in wraps either, but this time it will not serve me as it should.'
CJ|0|82|15|0|Here Maronius said, 'As for me, I understand the matter like this: I must not reach for things too far away, for my arm is short for that.
CJ|0|82|16|0|It would of course be quite an honor to be a blissful Phaeton,
CJ|0|82|17|0|but what is a weak mortal to do when the sun has orbited its course too far above him?
CJ|0|82|18|0|He must be content with only her light while he quite good-naturedly leaves the honor and power of leading the sun to those beings who surely have longer arms than he, the weak mortal!
CJ|0|82|19|0|And just how long the invisible arm of this Child is we convinced ourselves of yesterday.
CJ|0|82|20|0|So, consular, imperial highness, do I not exactly understand what this wise man has spoken?'
CJ|0|82|21|0|Cyrenius agreed with Maronius, composed his heart and in good spirits went into the villa with Joseph and refreshed himself at the frugal meal.
CJ|0|82|22|0|But the three priests hardly dared to keep their eyes open, for they believed that the Child was either Zeus or even Fate Itself.
CJ|0|83|1|1|The Fear Of The Three Priests
CJ|0|83|1|0|WHEN THE MEAL was over and all had risen from the table, one of the priests went over to Joseph and asked him in deepest humility,
CJ|0|83|2|0|'Uranus or at least Saturn as father of Zeus! For that you surely are incarnate, although you attempted to hide your divinity before us a while back in the city,
CJ|0|83|3|0|which you did only to test whether we would actually recognize you or not.
CJ|0|83|4|0|Only for a time did we fail to recognize you, and for that we ask your forgiveness of our great blindness.
CJ|0|83|5|0|But the recent manner of speech of your Child has opened all our eyes and we now know exactly where we stand.
CJ|0|83|6|0|So make us happy to the extent of telling us how we shall bring you a sacrifice, as well as to your divine wife and to your Child, who is surely the by your omnipotence self-rejuvenated Zeus!'
CJ|0|83|7|0|Joseph was amazed at this sudden change in the three priests to whom, while they were still in the city, he had explained the false premise of their paganism clearly and quite comprehensibly.
CJ|0|83|8|0|He therefore considered what he should answer them now. - Here the Baby wanted to be brought over to Joseph at once,
CJ|0|83|9|0|and when He arrived there on the arms of James He promptly said to Joseph,
CJ|0|83|10|0|'Leave these poor souls in peace, do not rebuke them, for they are blind and sleep and dream.
CJ|0|83|11|0|Just keep them here for a few days, and My brothers will undoubtedly awaken them from their sleep and dream. When they will see that you pray to God yourselves, they will surely forget their Uranus, Saturn and Zeus!'
CJ|0|83|12|0|These words put Joseph completely at his ease, and he at once offered to let the three priests live under his roof until some way of enabling them to earn a living would present itself.
CJ|0|83|13|0|The three priests, hardly daring to breathe for sheer awe, dared all the less to refuse the offer, since they did not have the least idea what they should do next.
CJ|0|83|14|0|They therefore accepted the offer, but among themselves they murmured,
CJ|0|83|15|0|'Oh, if it were only possible to run away from here and hide in some remote corner of the earth, how happy we would be!
CJ|0|83|16|0|But as it now is we must remain here in full view of the obviously main gods. Oh what anguish that is for us as those least worthy!'
CJ|0|83|17|0|Cyrenius noticed this murmuring among the three, therefore went over and wanted to call them to account for it.
CJ|0|83|18|0|But the Baby said, 'My Cyrenius, stay back, for it is not unknown to Me what is taking place in the three.
CJ|0|83|19|0|Their plan is the product of their blindness and their foolish fear and concerns itself with nothing else than a flight from us into some most remote corner of the earth.
CJ|0|83|20|0|See, that is all it amounts to, so you need not become concerned.
CJ|0|83|21|0|Just leave the jurisdiction in this house to Me, and be assured that no injustice will be done to anyone!'
CJ|0|83|22|0|Cyrenius was content with that and again went into the open with Joseph, while the three priests went into the room assigned to them.
CJ|0|84|1|1|The Mythology Of Ostracine
CJ|0|84|1|0|WHEN THEY ARRIVED in the open, Joseph and Cyrenius began to discuss several things among themselves, while Mary in the meantime took care of the Baby in the house
CJ|0|84|2|0|and the sons of Joseph concerned themselves with looking after the chores around the house, wherewith the servants of Cyrenius rendered them various services.
CJ|0|84|3|0|After several discussions of lesser importance between Joseph and Cyrenius accompanied by Maronius Pilla, an important point came up for discussion, which was initiated by Cyrenius and was as follows,
CJ|0|84|4|0|'Worthy friend and brother! See, the city and the whole large domain which also comes under the jurisdiction of the city surely amounts to eighty-thousand people.
CJ|0|84|5|0|Among them there are only very few of your belief and your religion.
CJ|0|84|6|0|For thousands of years according to my knowledge they were more or less confirmed worshipers of idols.
CJ|0|84|7|0|They have all of their pagan temples in this age-old city, of which the myth says that it was built at the time of the war of the gods with the Giants of the Earth, and that Zeus himself had it built as a symbol of the victory over these Giants of the Earth.
CJ|0|84|8|0|Mercury had to gather the bones of the Giants and sink them in the sea, which is how this land is supposed to have come into being.
CJ|0|84|9|0|Over these Giant-bones Zeus is then supposed to have let it rain sand and ashes and now and then large and heavy stones.
CJ|0|84|10|0|Thereupon Zeus is said to have ordered the old Ceres that she should make this land fruitful and in its center build a citadel and a city not too far from the sea as a sign of the great victory.
CJ|0|84|11|0|Zeus himself would then bring forth from the earth a people which would inhabit this land and this city for all time to come.
CJ|0|84|12|0|'From this my story you can easily see that this people, probably like no other on the face of the earth, is still of the unshakable opinion that it inhabits the city which the gods themselves have built,
CJ|0|84|13|0|for which reason you always see these terribly rundown dwellings, since no human being dares to make any repairs on the work of the gods so he will not commit a sin against them.
CJ|0|84|14|0|As something quite out of the ordinary the old Ceres, assisted by Mercury and Apollo, is supposed to have built the temples with her own hands. -
CJ|0|84|15|0|That is the myth and at the same time the so far unshakable faith of this otherwise good-natured people, which despite its poverty is very hospitable and exceptionally honest.
CJ|0|84|16|0|But what is to be done here if this people should demand the reconstruction of the temples?
CJ|0|84|17|0|Should one rebuild the temples for it or not, or should one convert it to your doctrine?
CJ|0|84|18|0|And if one does that, what will the neighboring peoples who also visit this city on occasion say to that, since it has been all the more of a ruin than an actual city for a very long time?'
CJ|0|85|1|1|Anxiety Negates God's Help
CJ|0|85|1|0|CYRENIUS CONTINUED, 'Oh friend, that is surely a very difficult situation.
CJ|0|85|2|0|If you have any counsel for that in the living chamber of your truly divine wisdom, then let me hear it.
CJ|0|85|3|0|For the more I think about this matter now, the more critical and complicated it appears!'
CJ|0|85|4|0|And Joseph replied to Cyrenius: 'Listen to me, my esteemed friend! It is very easy to help you out of this predicament.
CJ|0|85|5|0|I will give you some good advice in this matter which will show you what is right and what you should do.
CJ|0|85|6|0|'See, in your heart you are now of my living faith and love and honor the one true God along with me!
CJ|0|85|7|0|Now I will tell you this: As long as you are filled with anxiety, God will do nothing for you.
CJ|0|85|8|0|But as soon as you lay all your troubles upon Him and are only concerned and anxious as to how you may know and love this true God ever more and more,
CJ|0|85|9|0|He will then begin to help you in all things, and everything which still appears crooked to you today will be made straight before you tomorrow.
CJ|0|85|10|0|Therefore have this city cleared of rubble only wherever people might still be buried beneath it, which is now being done.
CJ|0|85|11|0|But leave in ruins all other temples beneath whose rubble there lie nothing than at best a few very unshapely, worthless and smashed idols.
CJ|0|85|12|0|For that which is destroyed by the elements counts as much with this blind people as if the gods had destroyed it.
CJ|0|85|13|0|This people will therefore not even make the effort to rebuild these temples,
CJ|0|85|14|0|for it is afraid that if it is active contrary to the will of the gods, it could draw a great punishment upon itself.
CJ|0|85|15|0|Now there are no more such priests who on the basis of a fictitious demand of the gods would have undertaken this to their own advantage by the hands and means of the people -
CJ|0|85|16|0|and those who still live will never build temples for idols.
CJ|0|85|17|0|So you can be wholly without concern in this matter. The Lord of heaven and earth will bring about that which is best for you and for the whole people.
CJ|0|85|18|0|And in our time several cities will meet a similar fate anyhow in that they will be smothered with rubble here and there, so it will hardly be noticed when this old city becomes a complete ruin in ten years.'
CJ|0|85|19|0|These words of Joseph comforted Cyrenius, and he returned to the villa with him in a happy frame of mind.
CJ|0|86|1|1|The World Occasions No Loss For The Godly
CJ|0|86|1|0|WHEN THEY entered the dining room, Cyrenius asked Joseph, 'My very dear friend, see, a good thought has just come into my heart and my mind.
CJ|0|86|2|0|What do you think concerning the matter which we discussed outside and in which you undoubtedly gave me the best and most assuring advice - would it not be conducive toward putting my soul completely at ease
CJ|0|86|3|0|if I were to ask the three here present priests for their opinion?'
CJ|0|86|4|0|Joseph replied, 'If my counsel still does not satisfy you - you are the master here and can do what you please to ease your mind,
CJ|0|86|5|0|although I am of the opinion that not much is to be gained from these priests here as long as they hold me to be Uranus or Saturn and the Baby for the himself rejuvenating Zeus.
CJ|0|86|6|0|When you accordingly ask them about that which concerns you, they will manifestly refer you to me and to the Baby.'
CJ|0|86|7|0|When Cyrenius heard this from Joseph, he desisted from his wish and then said,
CJ|0|86|8|0|'Now I see it all clearly, my feelings are completely at ease and I can confidently dedicate my time to the business of state again.
CJ|0|86|9|0|Evening is already here, so I shall return to the city with my attendants,
CJ|0|86|10|0|but tomorrow afternoon I shall be with you again. And if I need any advice from you before that I shall ask you to come to me still before noon.'
CJ|0|86|11|0|Joseph now blessed Cyrenius and Maronius, whereupon Cyrenius went to the cradle and very gently kissed the sleeping Baby,
CJ|0|86|12|0|then arose and with tears in his eyes went on his way.
CJ|0|86|13|0|On the way he looked back at least a few hundred times toward the villa which was now worth more to him than all the treasures of the world.
CJ|0|86|14|0|Joseph also sent one blessing after the other after Cyrenius as long as he could still discover any trace of his party.
CJ|0|86|15|0|When nothing more was to be seen of Cyrenius, Joseph went back into the house and there to Mary, who just then - as was usual for her about this time - was deeply engrossed in prayer to God.
CJ|0|86|16|0|But as soon as she noticed Joseph at her side, she arose and said, 'Dear husband, truly, this day has totally upset me. The world, the world, it holds no gain for man!'
CJ|0|86|17|0|And Joseph said, 'My faithful wife, you are right, but I believe that as long as the Lord is with us, then we will not lose anything in the world either! So be of good cheer. Tomorrow the same old sun will again rise for us new and glorious: To the Lord alone be the glory forever! Amen!
CJ|0|87|1|1|A Psalm of David Enlightens The Three Priests
CJ|0|87|1|0|MARY, who never was given to many words nor ever after the manner of women wanted to have the last word, was content in her heart with the very plain and just as short consolation of Joseph.
CJ|0|87|2|0|She then went to rest, consecrated to the Lord by Joseph in his heart.
CJ|0|87|3|0|Joseph now went to his sons and said to them, 'Children, the evening is glorious and beautiful. Let us go out into the open.
CJ|0|87|4|0|There in the great holy temple of God we will strike up a song of praise and will thank the Lord for all the infinite blessings which He has bestowed on us and our fathers since the beginning of the world!'
CJ|0|87|5|0|Immediately the sons of Joseph left everything and followed their father.
CJ|0|87|6|0|And he led them to the top of a bare little hill which lay about a hundred steps from the villa as part of Joseph's estate and was about twenty fathoms high.
CJ|0|87|7|0|This was noticed by the three priests who supposed the gods were on their way perhaps to Olympus, so they might there hold a common council with all the gods.
CJ|0|87|8|0|Accordingly they quickly left their room and crept after Joseph very furtively and quietly.
CJ|0|87|9|0|Arrived at the little hill they listened beneath a thickly foliated fig-tree to hear what the supposed gods might counsel among themselves on Olympus.
CJ|0|87|10|0|But how greatly were they surprised among themselves, when they heard the supposed gods of the highest order worship and sing praises to one God powerfully and with feeling.
CJ|0|87|11|0|And the following passages of a Psalm of David had a very special effect on them, which passages were as follows:
CJ|0|87|12|0|'Lord God, You are our refuge forever! Before the mountains came into being and the earth and the world were created, You are God from eternity to eternity!
CJ|0|87|13|0|You are He who sends death to mankind and says, Come back, o children of men!
CJ|0|87|14|0|For a thousand years are to You like a day which passed away yesterday, and like a watch in the night.
CJ|0|87|15|0|You let them pass by like a stream, and they are like a sleep and like grass which is become withered,
CJ|0|87|16|0|Which flourishes early and soon withers, is hoed up in the evening and soon parches.
CJ|0|87|17|0|Your anger causes us to pass away, and your wrath makes us depart so suddenly.
CJ|0|87|18|0|For You place our transgression before You and our unrecognized sin into the light before Your countenance.
CJ|0|87|19|0|Therefore all of our days pass away because of Your wrath, and we idle away our years like gossip.
CJ|0|87|20|0|Our life lasts about seventy years, and if it goes high it amounts to eighty years, and when it has been precious it was filled with toil and trouble; for it passes by quickly, as if we were flying away.
CJ|0|87|21|0|Now who believes that You are so angry and who is afraid of Your wrath?
CJ|0|87|22|0|So teach us to bear in mind that we must die, so we may become wise.
CJ|0|87|23|0|O Lord, turn to us again and be gracious to Your servants.
CJ|0|87|24|0|Fill us early with Your grace, and we will praise You and be joyful in You our whole life long!
CJ|0|87|25|0|Now gladden us again, after You have afflicted us for a long time and we were in distress for so long.
CJ|0|87|26|0|Show Your works to Your servants and Your glory to their children!
CJ|0|87|27|0|And You, Lord, our God, be kind to us and further the work of our hands with us - yes, be gracious to further the work of our hands!'
CJ|0|87|28|0|When the three had plainly heard this song, they promptly returned to their room.
CJ|0|87|29|0|And one said to the other two, 'Truly, they can be no gods who thus pray to a God and even acknowledge His anger and wrath toward them!'
CJ|0|87|30|0|And another remarked, 'That would actually be the least part of it - but that this prayer applies directly to us, that is the fly in the ointment!
CJ|0|87|31|0|So be quiet now - the worshipers are returning. But tomorrow we will test this matter more thoroughly for ourselves, so just be quiet today for they are coming!'
CJ|0|88|1|1|The Death And Reawakening Of Joel
CJ|0|88|1|0|JOSEPH NOW told his sons to complete their unfinished chores and then to retire.
CJ|0|88|2|0|And since his limbs were weary, he also promptly retired.
CJ|0|88|3|0|Thus this day, which was rich in experience, came to a close. -
CJ|0|88|4|0|The following day Joseph was up as usual a good while before sunrise and also awakened his sons to work.
CJ|0|88|5|0|For he said, 'The early bird catches the worm - what we do in the morning is more blessed than all the rest of the day's toil.'
CJ|0|88|6|0|Thus, with the exception of James who had to remain with the Baby, he went right out to an acre and cultivated it with the other four sons.
CJ|0|88|7|0|Now the oldest son labored most industriously and wanted to surpass the other three.
CJ|0|88|8|0|And behold, as he quite busily struck the spade into the earth, he suddenly lifted a very poisonous snake out of the ground.
CJ|0|88|9|0|And the snake moved quickly against him and bit him in the foot.
CJ|0|88|10|0|Hereupon the three younger brothers rushed over and killed the snake - but for all that the brother's foot swelled up visibly. A dizziness came over him, and he soon sank down into death.
CJ|0|88|11|0|Joseph and the three younger brothers began to lament and entreated God to restore Joel to life again for them.
CJ|0|88|12|0|And Joseph put a curse on the snake and said to the three, 'From now on a snake shall never more crawl on this ground!
CJ|0|88|13|0|Now pick up your brother and carry him home, for it must thus have pleased the Lord that He took the heir away from me!'
CJ|0|88|14|0|And the three brothers wept and carried Joel home, and Joseph rent his garment and followed them lamenting.
CJ|0|88|15|0|When they came to the house, Mary, who was holding the Child and had become frightened by the lament, quickly came to meet them, and James followed her.
CJ|0|88|16|0|Both emitted a cry of anguish when they beheld the lifeless Joel and Joseph with his rent garment.
CJ|0|88|17|0|The three priests also came over quickly and were considerably shocked at the sight of the corpse.
CJ|0|88|18|0|And one of them admitted to Joseph, 'Only now do I fully believe that you are only a man - for if you were a god, how could your children die, and how would you fail to promptly awaken them?'
CJ|0|88|19|0|Here the Baby said: 'You are all mistaken! Joel is in a stupor and sleeps - but he is not dead!
CJ|0|88|20|0|Go and bring a sea-onion; lay it upon his wound, and it soon will be better with him!'
CJ|0|88|21|0|In haste Joseph went after such an onion and laid it upon Joel's wound.
CJ|0|88|22|0|In a few moments Joel awoke and asked them all what had happened to him.
CJ|0|88|23|0|Those around him quickly told him everything and praised and honored God for saving him, and the three priests came into a great respect of the Child - but into a still greater respect of the onion.
CJ|0|89|1|1|A Penitent Heart The Only Acceptable Sacrifice
CJ|0|89|1|0|FOLLOWING THIS Joseph with his entire family promptly went into the bedroom and honored and praised God loudly an hour long
CJ|0|89|2|0|and also made a vow by which he bound himself to bring a sacrifice to the Lord as soon as he should come to Jerusalem again.
CJ|0|89|3|0|Hereupon the Baby said to Joseph: 'Now listen to Me! Do you suppose that the Lord is pleased with that?
CJ|0|89|4|0|Oh, there you are greatly mistaken! See, neither in burnt offerings, nor in the blood of animals and just as little in flour, oil and grain does the Lord take pleasure,
CJ|0|89|5|0|but solely in a penitent, remorseful and humble heart that loves Him above all things.
CJ|0|89|6|0|If you have anything to spare, then give to those who are hungry and thirsty, and you will bring the Lord a fitting sacrifice!
CJ|0|89|7|0|I therefore release you from your vow and the duty for the temple because I have the full power to do so.
CJ|0|89|8|0|And I shall one day fill your vow in Jerusalem Myself in such a way that the whole earth will be satiated thereby for eternity!'
CJ|0|89|9|0|Here Joseph took the Baby on his arms and kissed Him and then said to Him,
CJ|0|89|10|0|'My dearly beloved little Jesus, Your Joseph thanks You for that from his whole heart and recognizes the wholly divine truth of Your most wonderful declaration,
CJ|0|89|11|0|but You see, God, Your and all our Father, has still ordained such through Moses and the prophets and ordered us, His children, to keep it!
CJ|0|89|12|0|Oh tell me, my little Son: do You, although of divine and hallowed descent, really have the right to suspend the laws of the great Father who eternally lives in His heavens?'
CJ|0|89|13|0|And the Baby answered: 'Joseph, though I were to tell you who I am, you would not believe Me anyhow since you see in Me only a human being!
CJ|0|89|14|0|But I tell you just the same that where I am, there also is the Father - and where I am not, there neither is the Father!
CJ|0|89|15|0|I am now here and not in the temple - how then should the Father be in the temple?
CJ|0|89|16|0|Do you understand that? - Behold, where the Father's love is, there also is His heart. And the Father's love is within Me and therewith also His heart!
CJ|0|89|17|0|Now no one carries his heart outside of himself, and so neither does the Father - where His heart is, there He is also! Do you understand this?'
CJ|0|89|18|0|These words filled Joseph, Mary as well as the five sons with a profound, sacred presentiment. And they went outside and praised the so-near Father in their hearts; and Mary then prepared a morning meal.
CJ|0|90|1|1|A Pagan Custom Is Rejected For The Lord's Table
CJ|0|90|1|0|THE MORNING MEAL was soon prepared, for it consisted of nothing else than a pot of simmered milk, some honey with thyme, and bread.
CJ|0|90|2|0|Mary brought it on the table herself and called Joseph and the five sons as well as the three priests to the table.
CJ|0|90|3|0|Joseph soon appeared with the Child on his arm, handed Him to the mother and then went to the table.
CJ|0|90|4|0|Here he promptly struck up his song of praise to the Lord, and when the song of praise was rendered Joseph asked according to the usual custom whether everyone had washed.
CJ|0|90|5|0|Mary, the five sons and the Baby said, 'Yes, we are all washed quite well.'
CJ|0|90|6|0|Joseph replied, 'Then you may also eat. But what about you three? Did you also wash?'
CJ|0|90|7|0|Here the priests said, 'It is not the custom with us to wash with water in the morning, but only in the evening.
CJ|0|90|8|0|In the morning we anoint ourselves with oil, so the heat of the day will not bother us too much.'
CJ|0|90|9|0|And Joseph retorted, 'That may be in order, for if I came into your house I would do the same as you -
CJ|0|90|10|0|but since you are now my guests then observe my custom, for it is better than yours.'
CJ|0|90|11|0|But the priests asked that they might be exempted therefrom.
CJ|0|90|12|0|At this Joseph wanted to let the priests off from washing-
CJ|0|90|13|0|but the Baby asserted, 'Truly, to stone shall every bite turn in their stomachs unless they first wash themselves clean with water before they partake at the table where I am present!'
CJ|0|90|14|0|These words immediately broke the three priests of their custom and they requested water and washed themselves.
CJ|0|90|15|0|After they had washed, Joseph promptly invited them to the table again,
CJ|0|90|16|0|but the priests declined to do so and dared not - for they feared the Child.
CJ|0|90|17|0|And the Baby warned, 'If you now refuse to go to the table and keep the blessed morning meal with us, you will die!
CJ|0|90|18|0|Here the priests quickly went to the table and ate in great secret awe of the Child.
CJ|0|90|19|0|When the morning meal was consumed, Joseph again arose and gave thanks to God.
CJ|0|90|20|0|Thereupon the priests asked him, 'Just which God are you thanking? Is not this Child the foremost, true God? How then can you thank another?'
CJ|0|90|21|0|This question puzzled Joseph greatly, and he did not know what he should answer thereto.
CJ|0|90|22|0|But the Baby said, 'Joseph, do not concern yourself in vain, for what the three have said will be fulfilled. Do not be concerned now, for you still pray to only one God and Father.'
CJ|0|91|1|1|Love - The Only True Prayer
CJ|0|91|1|0|JOSEPH KISSED the Baby and said, 'Yes truly, if the Father's heart were not in You, You would never be capable of such words!
CJ|0|91|2|0|For where in the whole earth is there a child of Your age which would be capable of speaking such words of itself, which no wise man has ever spoken!
CJ|0|91|3|0|Tell me therefore whether I should worship You wholly as my God and Lord!'
CJ|0|91|4|0|This question took all present by surprise.
CJ|0|91|5|0|And the Baby smilingly replied: 'Joseph, do you really know how man should pray to God?
CJ|0|91|6|0|See, you do not know that completely, so I will tell you.
CJ|0|91|7|0|Listen! In spirit and in truth shall man pray to God, but not with the lips as the children of the world do, who suppose that they have served God by having exercised their lips for a time.
CJ|0|91|8|0|And if you want to pray in spirit and in truth, then love God in your heart and do good to all friends and enemies, and your prayer will be just before God!
CJ|0|91|9|0|Now if someone has exercised his lips before God at certain periods for a short time and during this exercise thought of all manner of worldly things which were closer to his heart than all his loose prayer, yes, closer than God Himself - say, can that really be called prayer?
CJ|0|91|10|0|Truly, millions of such prayers are heard by God in exactly the same way as a stone hears the voice of one crying aloud!
CJ|0|91|11|0|But if you pray to God by means of love, then you need never ask whether you should worship Me now as the most holy God and Father.
CJ|0|91|12|0|Whoever prays to God like that, he also prays to Me. For the Father and I are of one love and one heart.'
CJ|0|91|13|0|These words were clearly understood by all, and they knew why Jesus was to be called: Son of God.
CJ|0|91|14|0|Joseph's breast was now full of the greatest heavenly joy.
CJ|0|91|15|0|And Mary rejoiced secretly over the Baby and kept all such words in her heart, as did the sons of Joseph.
CJ|0|91|16|0|And the three priests said to Joseph, 'Truly exalted wise man of all ages!
CJ|0|91|17|0|We would like to speak a few quite secret words alone with you on that little hill where you prayed to your God with your sons in such a heartfelt and edifying manner last evening!'
CJ|0|91|18|0|Here the Baby immediately interrupted the conversation and stated,
CJ|0|91|19|0|'Do you really suppose My ear to be incapable of hearing the words of your mouth on the little hill? Oh, there you are mistaken, for My ears reach as far as My hands! So you may as well have your discussion right here in front of Me!'
CJ|0|92|1|1|Build Me A Temple in Your Hearts
CJ|0|92|1|0|THIS GREATLY EMBARRASSED the three priests, and they did not know what to do, for they did not dare reveal their desire to Joseph in the presence of the Child.
CJ|0|92|2|0|Here the Baby looked at them and said in a very firm tone of voice:
CJ|0|92|3|0|'Would you not like to make an idol out of Me also?
CJ|0|92|4|0|There on yonder little hill you would like to build a temple, in it erect a wood-carving after Me on a golden altar and then sacrifice to this wood-carving according to your custom.
CJ|0|92|5|0|Just attempt something like that, and I tell you truly: the first one who takes one step for that purpose and stretches out only one finger shall be a dead man on the spot!
CJ|0|92|6|0|'Now if you really want to build Me a temple, then build one that is alive in your hearts!
CJ|0|92|7|0|For I am alive, and not dead, and therefore want living, but never dead temples!
CJ|0|92|8|0|And since you already believe that the fullness of the Deity dwells in Me bodily, am I Myself then not enough of a living temple before You? Why should there also be a wood-carving and a stone temple in preference to Me?
CJ|0|92|9|0|For what is more, I - or some meaningless temple and wood-carving of Me?
CJ|0|92|10|0|If the Living One is with you and among you, of what good and useful purpose then is one that is dead?
CJ|0|92|11|0|Oh you blind fools! Is it not more that you love Me, than if you were to build Me a thousand temples of stone and exercise your lips in them for a thousand years while dressed in hemmed garments in front of carved images of Me?
CJ|0|92|12|0|And if a poor man who was naked and hungry and thirsty came to you,
CJ|0|92|13|0|but you were to say: See, he is a half-god, for thus do these high beings appear,
CJ|0|92|14|0|so let us make an image of him and then set it up in a temple, so we might worship it! -
CJ|0|92|15|0|Tell Me, if you did that, would it really have been any help to the poor man, even though you were to form his image of pure gold?
CJ|0|92|16|0|And will it not be more advantageous to the poor man if you clothe him according to your love and then hand him food and drink?
CJ|0|92|17|0|'Is God not more alive than every man on the earth, since everything has its life from Him?
CJ|0|92|18|0|Is God perhaps blind, who created the sun and gave you a seeing eye?
CJ|0|92|19|0|Or is He deaf, who made your ear for you, and He without feelings, who gave you your senses?
CJ|0|92|20|0|See, how foolish it would be to think and speak like that!
CJ|0|92|21|0|Accordingly it follows that God is the most perfect Life Itself, therefore the most perfect Love. How then will you honor and worship Him as one that is dead? -
CJ|0|92|22|0|Consider this, so you may be healed of your blindness!'
CJ|0|92|23|0|These words caused the three priests to fall to the ground, for they grasped their divine truth and spoke no more that day.
CJ|0|93|1|1|A Blind Beggar Woman Regains Her Sight
CJ|0|93|1|0|WHEN THEY HAD THUS SHOWN their highest esteem, the three priests returned to their assigned chamber and remained there until sundown.
CJ|0|93|2|0|They spoke nothing, for each one of them reflected on the words of the wondrously talking Child.
CJ|0|93|3|0|Joseph gave God the glory in his heart and fervently gave thanks for the infinitely great grace that he had become the foster-father of the Son of God.
CJ|0|93|4|0|When he had thus given God the honor and the glory with Mary and his sons and Mary had also looked after the Baby,
CJ|0|93|5|0|the baby was again given over to James. Joseph had Mary mend the torn garment and then went out to the acre again with his four sons and tended it.
CJ|0|93|6|0|Mary in the meantime cleaned the furnishings of the house so they might be clean for the reception of the guests, who had promised to return in the afternoon.
CJ|0|93|7|0|When she was through with cleaning, she again looked after the Child to see if He needed anything.
CJ|0|93|8|0|And the Baby wanted the breast and then a bath, and that with clean, cold water.
CJ|0|93|9|0|Mary did all this promptly, and when she had bathed the Baby, a blind woman came into the room to Mary and complained much about her wretchedness.
CJ|0|93|10|0|Mary said to the blind woman, i can plainly see that you are very poorly off, but what can I do to help you?'
CJ|0|93|11|0|And the woman said, 'Listen to me! Last night I had a marvelous dream.
CJ|0|93|12|0|I saw that you had a very brightly shining Child. This Child wanted your breast and a bath.
CJ|0|93|13|0|The bath consisted of fresh water - and when you had bathed the Child therein the water was filled with shining stars.
CJ|0|93|14|0|I then recalled that I am blind, and was not a little surprised that it was possible for me to see all this.
CJ|0|93|15|0|But you said to me in the meantime: Woman, so then take this water and wash your eyes - and you will see!
CJ|0|93|16|0|I then wanted to reach for the water immediately and wash my eyes, but thereupon awakened - and am still blind!
CJ|0|93|17|0|But this morning someone said to me, Go outside and seek! You will meet the woman with the Child, for you will not enter any house save that one only!
CJ|0|93|18|0|Now I am here at the end of my great toil, fear and danger!'
CJ|0|93|19|0|Here Mary handed the bathwater to the blind woman, and the woman washed her face in it and instantly regained her sight.
CJ|0|93|20|0|At this the woman was beside herself with great joy and gratitude and at once wanted to herald this about in all of Ostracine, but Mary forbade the woman this most emphatically.
CJ|0|94|1|1|A Prophecy For Mary
CJ|0|94|1|0|THE WOMAN then entreated Mary to let her remain with her for a time, so she might serve the house in which such great salvation had come to her.
CJ|0|94|2|0|And Mary said, 'Woman, that is not up to me, for I am only a handmaiden of the Lord myself,
CJ|0|94|3|0|but wait here a while until my husband returns home from the field. He will let you know what is to be done!'
CJ|0|94|4|0|Here the woman fell at Mary's feet and wanted to downright worship her as a goddess, for she considered the healing of her eyesight as too great a wonder, since she was born blind.
CJ|0|94|5|0|But Mary sternly rebuked her and departed into another room.
CJ|0|94|6|0|The woman then began to weep at this, for she was of the opinion that she had thus offended her greatest benefactress.
CJ|0|94|7|0|At this James, who was coaxing the Baby in the same room, looked at the woman and asked her,
CJ|0|94|8|0|'Why do you weep as if someone had hurt you?'
CJ|0|94|9|0|The woman replied, 'Oh, you dear youth! I have just offended her who gave me the light of my eyes! Why should I then not weep?'
CJ|0|94|10|0|Here James said, 'Oh, worry about something else! The young woman who handed you the bath-water is gentler than a turtle-dove, so she can never be offended.
CJ|0|94|11|0|And if anyone did want to offend her, he still is not able to do so,
CJ|0|94|12|0|for she then blesses him ten times for an offence and entreats the offender for his friendship again in such a manner that even the hardest stone could not resist!
CJ|0|94|13|0|See, that is how good this woman is! So just do not worry, for I can assure you that right now she is praying to God for you.'
CJ|0|94|14|0|And so it was - Mary was indeed praying to God for this woman that He might enlighten her understanding so she then would realize that she, Mary, was only a frail woman also.
CJ|0|94|15|0|Mary was indeed of the highest nobility not only naturally (in that she was of the direct lineage of a king) but her joy consisted therein that she be humbled everywhere and by everyone.
CJ|0|94|16|0|After a while the dear, good Mary returned and earnestly asked the woman to forgive her in case she might have spoken to her too sternly.
CJ|0|94|17|0|This behavior of Mary almost took the thankful woman's life from sheer love of Mary.
CJ|0|94|18|0|And the woman exclaimed in the full rapture of her love,
CJ|0|94|19|0|'Oh you dear psyche of my sex, what your noblest heart has rebuked me of, nations will one day bring you!
CJ|0|94|20|0|For among all the women on earth you are surely the first who stands in a covenant with the high gods all the more surely, since beside your truly divine goodness you are also so inexpressibly kind, gracious and lovely!'
CJ|0|94|21|0|Here Mary stated, 'Dear woman, after I am dead people can do with me what they like, but during my lifetime that shall not happen!'
CJ|0|94|22|0|Here Joseph returned with the four sons, and Mary at once led the woman to him and told him all that had happened.
CJ|0|95|1|1|Sic Transit Gloria Mundi
CJ|0|95|1|0|WHEN THE WOMAN quickly saw that Joseph was Mary's husband, she went over to him with the request that she might remain in his house.
CJ|0|95|2|0|Joseph replied to the woman, 'Since such grace was bestowed on you as my wife told me in your presence, and you therefore wish to be grateful to this house, you may as well remain.
CJ|0|95|3|0|See, I have a fairly large piece of land here, several domestic animals and a roomy house.
CJ|0|95|4|0|So there is plenty to do and there is also enough room to live here.
CJ|0|95|5|0|My wife is anyhow of a weaker nature in her bodily strength, so you will render me a good service if you will help her here and there in her housework.
CJ|0|95|6|0|All your needs shall be taken care of, but I can give you no wages in money since I have none myself.
CJ|0|95|7|0|If you are satisfied with this offer, you may remain here as long as you please, but not from any imaginary sense of duty!'
CJ|0|95|8|0|These words made the woman, who was a very poor orphan anyway, very happy indeed and she praised the house beyond measure in which so much good came her way.
CJ|0|95|9|0|Joseph asked her about her birthplace and about her age, and what her religion might be.
CJ|0|95|10|0|The woman answered, 'Man worthy of all esteem, I was born in Rome and am the daughter of a powerful patrician!
CJ|0|95|11|0|My elderly appearance belies my age, for I am since hardly twenty summers a dweller on the earth.
CJ|0|95|12|0|I was born blind, and a priest counseled my parents to bring me to Delphi where I would regain my eyesight by the grace of Apollo.
CJ|0|95|13|0|When this advice was given my parents I was ten years and seven months old.
CJ|0|95|14|0|My parents, who were very wealthy and loved me as their only daughter beyond measure, followed this advice.
CJ|0|95|15|0|They rented a ship so they might steer to Delphi with me.
CJ|0|95|16|0|But we were on the sea hardly three days when a most powerful storm came and drove the ship into this region with the greatest speed.
CJ|0|95|17|0|About two-hundred fathoms from the shore - as he who saved my life often told me - the ship was thrown on a cliff,
CJ|0|95|18|0|and everyone - except myself and a sailor who saved me - perished, and thus also my good parents.
CJ|0|95|19|0|The opportunity never came to return to the city of my fathers. The sailor also died here five years ago and I am now an orphaned beggarmaid in this place, wasted away by great want and sadness.
CJ|0|95|20|0|But since I have found such grace surely by the gods and have received the light of my eyes and can now see my benefactors, I will gladly forget my great sorrow!'
CJ|0|95|21|0|This tale of the seeming woman brought all to tears, and Joseph said, 'Oh, you poor orphan, be comforted, for here you shall find your parents again many times over!"
CJ|0|96|1|1|The Woman's Immeasurable Gain
CJ|0|96|1|0|THE SEEMING WOMAN did not fully understand what Joseph meant by the gaining of several parents, therefore she asked him,
CJ|0|96|2|0|'Oh you dear, most kind man, in whose house such an infinitely wonderful and great grace has befallen me, just what do you mean by your word that I shall find my lost parents again here many times over?'
CJ|0|96|3|0|And Joseph assured her: 'Truly, you shall be held equal to my children in my house as long as you live!
CJ|0|96|4|0|You shall learn to know the only and eternally true God with me, who is the Same That created you and now gave you back the light of your eyes!
CJ|0|96|5|0|Yes, you shall learn to know your Lord and God personally and shall be taught by Him Himself!
CJ|0|96|6|0|Very soon you will also meet a high Roman here in my house, who will order your affairs in Rome.
CJ|0|96|7|0|This Roman is Cyrenius, a brother of Augustus.
CJ|0|96|8|0|He undoubtedly knew your parents and upon my prompting will surely apply himself in Rome in the matter of your parents for your sake. And that will surely be the same as your parents many times over, in body and in spirit!
CJ|0|96|9|0|For if your earthly parents were alive somewhere, say, could these do more for you?
CJ|0|96|10|0|Would they have restored the sight of your eyes to you, and could they have shown you the one eternal and true God?
CJ|0|96|11|0|Your parents would of course have provided for your earthly needs, but here you will be provided for forever if you will only accept this care.
CJ|0|96|12|0|Say, what is more? Your earthly parents whom the sea has swallowed, or those you have now, whom the sea must obey in the name of the one God?'
CJ|0|96|13|0|Here the seeming woman was completely silent from all her great respect and love for Joseph.
CJ|0|96|14|0|For she supposed, since she had anyhow heard it whispered here and there, that Zeus lived somewhere in the vicinity of Ostracine, and that she was now in his bodily presence.
CJ|0|96|15|0|But Joseph very soon discerned the delusion of the woman and admonished her,
CJ|0|96|16|0|'Oh maiden, oh daughter! Whatever you do, do not hold me to be more than I am, and least of all for something that does not exist!
CJ|0|96|17|0|I am a human being just as you are - that is all you need to know for the present. In time you will receive more light, so let us let the matter rest now.
CJ|0|96|18|0|And now bring in the noonday meal; afterward we will acquaint ourselves with a number of things. So let it be!'
CJ|0|97|1|1|Joseph Adopts A Lovely Daughter
CJ|0|97|1|0|THE SONS of Joseph went at once and brought in the midday meal.
CJ|0|97|2|0|Here Joseph said, 'What happened to the three? Are they going to have the midday meal with us, or would they rather eat in their room today?
CJ|0|97|3|0|Go and inquire about that, and what pleases them the most shall be done!'
CJ|0|97|4|0|And the sons went and asked the three, but these said nothing and motioned to the sons that they would partake of nothing before sundown, whether food or drink.
CJ|0|97|5|0|This the sons reported to Joseph who was satisfied therewith and remarked,
CJ|0|97|6|0|'If the three have made that a matter of conscience, then we would sin against them if we hindered them from keeping their vow.
CJ|0|97|7|0|So let us take our places at the table in the name of the Lord and gratefully partake of what God has bestowed upon us.'
CJ|0|97|8|0|Hereupon the seeming woman said, 'Oh master of this house! You are too good and 1 am a nobody, therefore 1 am really not worthy to eat at your table. I will most gratefully partake of what your kindness will bestow on me in the entrance-hall of the house.
CJ|0|97|9|0|Besides, my too ragged clothes and my unwashed body are not seeming for the table of such a master as you are!'
CJ|0|97|10|0|Here Joseph told the sons, 'Go and bring four large jugs of water and place them in Mary's side room.
CJ|0|97|11|0|And you, wife, go and wash the woman, and comb her, and put your best clothes on her!
CJ|0|97|12|0|And when she is thus excellently and festively attired, lead her here so she can join us at the midday meal without shyness.'
CJ|0|97|13|0|In half an hour Joseph's wish was fulfilled, and fully cleansed there now stood in place of the woman a very sweet, timid and most thankful girl in whose face only traces of her former sadness still remained.
CJ|0|97|14|0|According to her features she was of great beauty, and in her eyes lay deep humility, but also deep love.
CJ|0|97|15|0|Joseph took real pleasure in this child and said, 'O Lord, I thank You that You have selected me to save this poor girl! In Your most holy name I will adopt her as a full daughter!'
CJ|0|97|16|0|And turning to the sons, he added, 'Look upon your poor sister, and greet her as brothers!'
CJ|0|97|17|0|This the sons of Joseph did with much joy, and finally the Baby also affirmed:
CJ|0|97|18|0|'Just as by you, so is she also adopted by Me! That is a good deed and gives Me much joy!'
CJ|0|97|19|0|When the girl heard the Baby speak like that she was astonished and asked, 'Oh wonder, what is this, that this Baby speaks like a God?'
CJ|0|98|1|1|The Maiden Recognizes The Baby
CJ|0|98|1|0|THE GIRL went right over to the Baby and declared:
CJ|0|98|2|0|'Oh what an extraordinary Wonder-Child You are!
CJ|0|98|3|0|Yes, you are the same shining Baby of which I dreamt so marvelously that the mother bathed, and that the same bathwater afterwards gave me the light of my eyes.
CJ|0|98|4|0|Yes, yes, You divine Baby! You gave me the light of my eyes! You are my Savior! You are the real Apollo of Delphi!
CJ|0|98|5|0|Yes, You already mean more to my heart than all the gods of Rome, Greece and Egypt!
CJ|0|98|6|0|What a high, divine Spirit must dwell in You, who has already loosed Your tongue so soon and who already makes Himself known through You so blessedly and powerfully!
CJ|0|98|7|0|Hail to you people of the earth, you who live along with me in great darkness and sorrow!
CJ|0|98|8|0|Here is the Sun of the heavens which will give you back sight to you blind ones, as to me!
CJ|0|98|9|0|Oh Rome, you mighty conqueress of the earth, see, here before me that Champion smiles at me who will transform you into a heap of rubble!
CJ|0|98|10|0|He will raise His standard over your walls and you will go to your grave! As a storm scatters loose chaff so will you be scattered!'
CJ|0|98|11|0|Here the Baby offered His hand to the girl and wanted to go to her.
CJ|0|98|12|0|And the girl took Him with great joy and loved and caressed Him.
CJ|0|98|13|0|Thereupon the Baby played with the rich curls of the girl and asked her very quietly,
CJ|0|98|14|0|'My dear sister, do you really believe the words which you expressed before Me when I was still on My brother's arm?'
CJ|0|98|15|0|And the girl replied just as quietly to the Baby,
CJ|0|98|16|0|'Yes, my Savior, my Light, my first morning Sun - now I believe it all the more firmly, since You asked me about it!'
CJ|0|98|17|0|And the Baby said thereto, 'Good for you, that you thus believe in your heart as you have spoken!
CJ|0|98|18|0|But I tell you this: Keep nothing more secret for the time being than just this your confession of faith!
CJ|0|98|19|0|For never has the enemy of all life sharpened his ear as much as during this very time!
CJ|0|98|20|0|Therefore be silent about Me and be sure not to reveal Me if you are concerned that this enemy will not slay you forever!'
CJ|0|98|21|0|This the girl pledged most emphatically and during the time that she fondled the Baby took on an appearance of such youthful, perfect beauty that all were greatly astonished thereat, and the girl became so ecstatic in her great bliss that she began to coo and loudly exult for joy.
CJ|0|99|1|1|Cyrenius Seeks The Maiden's Hand
CJ|0|99|1|0|WHILE THE GIRL was still enthralled in her great joy, Cyrenius, accompanied by Maronius Pilla, returned to Joseph as he had promised to do the previous evening.
CJ|0|99|2|0|Joseph and Mary received him with great, heartfelt joy, and Cyrenius said,
CJ|0|99|3|0|'Oh my esteemed friend and brother, what has befallen you, since to my great joy you are so happy?'
CJ|0|99|4|0|Joseph at once referred Cyrenius to the girl and stated,
CJ|0|99|5|0|'See, there with the Baby on her arms and sunk into deep bliss is the object of our joy!'
CJ|0|99|6|0|Cyrenius looked at the girl more closely and then asked Joseph,
CJ|0|99|7|0|'Did you take her into your service as a child-nurse? Where did this beautiful Israelite maiden come from?'
CJ|0|99|8|0|And Joseph answered the from curiosity burning Cyrenius,
CJ|0|99|9|0|'Oh eminent friend, see, a wonder brought her beneath this roof! She came to me blind, looking like an elderly, extremely poor beggar woman.
CJ|0|99|10|0|Then she received her sight through the wondrous power of the Baby, and it became evident that she is only a maiden of scarcely twenty summers, and since she is an orphan I have also adopted her as my daughter! That is the actual reason for our joy!'
CJ|0|99|11|0|And Cyrenius, while looking at the girl with constantly greater approbation, while she in her great bliss did not even notice him although he was present in full splendor, said to Joseph,
CJ|0|99|12|0|'Oh friend, oh brother, how much do I now regret that I am a Roman patrician!
CJ|0|99|13|0|Truly, I would give anything if I were now a Jew and could ask for this glorious Jewess of you for a wife!
CJ|0|99|14|0|For you know that I am single and childless. Oh what could such a wife, blessed by you, be to me!'
CJ|0|99|15|0|Hereupon Joseph smiled at Cyrenius and asked him, 'Just what would you do if this girl were no Jewess, but a Roman woman of high station, equal to yours?
CJ|0|99|16|0|If she were the only daughter of a patrician whose parents met their doom in the depths of the sea during a voyage to Delphi?'
CJ|0|99|17|0|At this Cyrenius looked at Joseph quite dumbfoundedly and said after a mute pause,
CJ|0|99|18|0|'Oh esteemed friend and brother! What are you saying? I beg you, explain yourself more clearly, for the matter seems to concern me closely!'
CJ|0|99|19|0|Joseph replied, 'My eminent friend! See, everything has its proper time, so you too must be a little patient here and the girl will tell you everything herself.
CJ|0|99|20|0|In the meantime, tell me how matters stand with the corpses which were dug out of the rubble of the temple.'
CJ|0|100|1|1|The Three-fold Roman Marriage Law
CJ|0|100|1|0|AND CYRENIUS said to Joseph, 'Oh friend and brother, do not concern yourself about the corpses. During the night about two hundred have been restored to life, and I have been busy all morning providing lodging for them.
CJ|0|100|2|0|If in the course of the rubble's removal several more unmaimed corpses should still be found, they will also be looked after just like the others.
CJ|0|100|3|0|See, that in short is the whole story which now does not nearly interest me as much as this maiden, who according to your most credible story is supposed to be the daughter of a come-to-grief Roman patrician!
CJ|0|100|4|0|Let me find out exactly how matters stand with this child, so that I may be able to help this poor orphan in every way possible!
CJ|0|100|5|0|See, as I told you recently, I am single and have no children. Could she possibly be better taken care of than if I, as a brother of the emperor, take her for my lawful wife?
CJ|0|100|6|0|For that reason the story of this girl becomes ever more important to me ahead of everything else.
CJ|0|100|7|0|So give me the opportunity to promptly speak with this glorious child and have a thorough discussion with her!'
CJ|0|100|8|0|Joseph now inquired of Cyrenius, 'Eminent friend and brother, you tell me that you are single, but you also told me in Tyre that you are married to one woman - only that you have no children with her.
CJ|0|100|9|0|Tell me, how am I to understand that? I know that you may take another wife if the first one is sterile; but how you as a wedded husband are still supposed to be single, truly, that I cannot understand! Explain yourself more clearly.'
CJ|0|100|10|0|Here Cyrenius smiled and replied, 'Dear friend, I see that you are not familiar with the laws of Rome. I will have to enlighten you, so hear me.
CJ|0|100|11|0|You see, we Romans have a three-fold right in marriage; two of them are not binding, only one is binding.
CJ|0|100|12|0|According to the two not binding laws I may marry even a slave woman but for all that I do not have a lawful wife, but only a lawfully permitted concubine. Thereby I am still single and can take a lawful wife at any time.
CJ|0|100|13|0|The difference between the first two not binding laws consists only in that, in the first case, I may take only a concubine - without the least obligation to ever take her as a legal wife.
CJ|0|100|14|0|In the second case I can also have the daughter of a house of appropriate social standing merely bound to me by her parents, with the stipulation to take her as a lawful wife if I beget one to three living children with her, of which at least one is a boy.
CJ|0|100|15|0|In the third case only does the firmly binding law go into effect, which states that I must first be firmly united with a lawful wife before the altar of Hymen by a priest set apart for that purpose and then am no more single, but married.
CJ|0|100|16|0|With us then neither the wedding (nuptias capere) nor the tentative matrimony (Patrimonium facere), but only the real marriage (uxorem ducere) cancels the single status according to the laws as they are now constituted.
CJ|0|100|17|0|Thus we can enter into nuptias capere, Patrimonium facere and uxorem ducere, and only the last can put an end to the single status!
CJ|0|100|18|0|See, that is why I am all the more single, since I am unable to beget any children with the concubine, and would be single even if I did have children with her because the children begotten with a concubine have no right to the father with us, unless the father adopts them with the emperor's consent!
CJ|0|100|19|0|Now you know everything, so I entreat you to acquaint me more closely with the history of this girl, for I am now wholly determined to marry her as soon as possible in the fullest sense of the word!'
CJ|0|100|20|0|When Joseph heard this from Cyrenius, he said, 'In that case I will first instruct and prepare the girl myself, lest such a proposal weaken or even kill her!'
CJ|0|101|1|1|Victor Aurelius Dexter Latii
CJ|0|101|1|0|JOSEPH THEN went over to the girl who was still occupied with the Baby, tugged at her sleeve and said to her,
CJ|0|101|2|0|'Listen, my beloved daughter, have you really not noticed who is here? Do look up for once and see!'
CJ|0|101|3|0|At this the girl awakened from her ecstasy and beheld the glittering Cyrenius.
CJ|0|101|4|0|Thereupon she was greatly startled and asked in a frightened tone of voice, 'Oh my dear father Joseph! Who is this so very brightly glittering man? What is he doing here? Where did he come from?'
CJ|0|101|5|0|Joseph answered the girl, 'Oh do not be afraid, my daughter Tullia! See, that is the ever so good Cyrenius, a brother of the emperor and governor of Asia and a part of Africa.
CJ|0|101|6|0|He will surely put your matter in the best order in Rome, for you have already become very dear to him at first glance.
CJ|0|101|7|0|Now go over and request that he hear you, then put your whole life story before him and be assured that you will not have spoken to deaf ears!'
CJ|0|101|8|0|But the girl objected, 'Oh my dear father, that I dare not do, for I know that such a lord examines with terrible strictness on such occasions, and if he finds out some point which cannot be proved, he promptly threatens one with death!
CJ|0|101|9|0|Thus it happened to me in my poverty once before when such a lord also inquired of me from whence I came.
CJ|0|101|10|0|When I faithfully told him everything, he demanded unquestionable proofs of me.
CJ|0|101|11|0|But since I in my completely orphaned state and in my utmost poverty could not produce these for him, he ordered me to keep strictest silence and threatened me with death if I should ever speak any more about that to anyone.
CJ|0|101|12|0|I therefore entreat you, do you also not betray me or I am surely lost!'
CJ|0|101|13|0|At this Cyrenius, who had heard this low discussion, stepped over to Tullia and said to her,
CJ|0|101|14|0|'Oh Tullia, do not fear him who truly wants to spare no effort to make you as happy as possible!
CJ|0|101|15|0|Tell me nothing more than the name of your father, if you still remember it, and I will require no more.
CJ|0|101|16|0|But fear nothing whatever, although your father's name is lost to you. You will be just as dear to me because you are now a daughter of this my greatest friend!'
CJ|0|101|17|0|At this Tullia became a bit more confident and admitted to Cyrenius, 'Truly, if your gentle eye deceives me, then the whole world is a lie! So I will indeed tell you the name of my good father.
CJ|0|101|18|0|See, his name was Victor Aurelius Dexter Latii - since you are a brother of the emperor, this name cannot be unknown to you.'
CJ|0|101|19|0|When Cyrenius heard this name he was visibly stirred and said in a broken voice,
CJ|0|101|20|0|'Oh Tullia, he was my mother's own brother! Yes, yes, of him I know that by his lawful wife he had a blind-born daughter whom he loved more than anything else!
CJ|0|101|21|0|Oh how often I have envied him his good fortune which actually was a misfortune! But the blind Tullia was more to him than the whole world.
CJ|0|101|22|0|Yes, I myself was quite in love with this Tullia when she was hardly four to five years old, and have often declared by myself: This one or no other shall someday be my real wife!
CJ|0|101|23|0|And - O God - now I find this same heavenly Tullia here in the house of my heavenly, godly friend!
CJ|0|101|24|0|O Lord, o Lord, that is too much reward at one time for a weak mortal and for the little that I, who am nothing before You, o Lord, did!' - Hereat Cyrenius, who had lost his strength, sank into a chair and only after a while regained his presence of mind to continue the conversation with Tullia.
CJ|0|102|1|1|A Gospel On Marriage Acceptable Before God
CJ|0|102|1|0|WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED, Cyrenius again inquired of Tullia, 'Tullia, would you not give me your hand and become my rightful wife, if I were to entreat you to do so from the very bottom of my heart?'
CJ|0|102|2|0|Here Tullia asked, 'What would you do with me if I were to deny you that?'
CJ|0|102|3|0|And Cyrenius, though somewhat agitated, nevertheless replied with genuine good will,
CJ|0|102|4|0|'Then I would sacrifice it to Him whom you hold upon your arms, and would sadly go my way!'
CJ|0|102|5|0|And Tullia asked Cyrenius further, saying, 'What would you do if I asked Him who now rests upon my arms for advice as to what I should do,
CJ|0|102|6|0|and He advised me against accepting your proposal and told me to remain faithful to the house which has received me in so friendly a say?'
CJ|0|102|7|0|Cyrenius was slightly taken aback by this question, and replied somewhat at a loss,
CJ|0|102|8|0|'Yes, then, my most wonderful Tullia, then of course I would at once and without objection have to desist from my petition!
CJ|0|102|9|0|For against the will of Him whom all the elements must obey, mortal man can eternally never oppose himself.
CJ|0|102|10|0|Oh but be sure to ask the Baby immediately, so I may find out where I stand as soon as possible!'
CJ|0|102|11|0|Here the Baby promptly sat upright and said: 'I am not a Lord of that which is of the world, hence you are free in all worldly matters as far as I am concerned!
CJ|0|102|12|0|Once you have found true love in your hearts toward one another then you shall not become unfaithful to it!
CJ|0|102|13|0|For with Me no other law counts in marriage than that which is written with glowing letters in your hearts.
CJ|0|102|14|0|If you have already recognized each other at first glance according to this living law and have bound yourselves, then you shall not separate any more if you do not want to commit a sin before Me!
CJ|0|102|15|0|I recognize no worldly bond of marriage other than that of the heart -
CJ|0|102|16|0|whoever breaks this, he is indeed an adulterer before Me!
CJ|0|102|17|0|You, My Cyrenius, have set your heart on this daughter ever so strongly, so you shall not turn it from her again. -
CJ|0|102|18|0|And you, daughter, were already burning in your heart for Cyrenius at first glance, therefore you already are his wife before Me and need not first become so!
CJ|0|102|19|0|For I accept neither worldly counsel nor objection, but only the counsel of your hearts.
CJ|0|102|20|0|Always remain faithful to this living law if you do not wish to become veritable adulterers before Me!
CJ|0|102|21|0|And let him be accursed who because of worldly considerations counsels against the matter of love, which is of Me!
CJ|0|102|22|0|For what is more: the living love which is from Me, or the worldly motive which is from hell?
CJ|0|102|23|0|Woe also to that love which is based on the world - let it be accursed!'
CJ|0|102|24|0|These words of the Baby confounded all, and no one dared to say any more on the subject of marriage.
CJ|0|103|1|1|The Seat Of Life Is In The Heart
CJ|0|103|1|0|AND SINCE after this discourse of the Baby all gazed down at their feet in consternation and no one trusted himself to speak, the Baby suddenly opened His mouth again and said:
CJ|0|103|2|0|'What are you all standing around Me for so sadly now? After all, I have not done you any harm!
CJ|0|103|3|0|To you, My Cyrenius, I gave whereafter your heart thirsted, and to you also, My dear Tullia. What more do you want?
CJ|0|103|4|0|'Should I perhaps declare the living adultery to be good, when you children of men have already set the punishment of death on the dead adultery?
CJ|0|103|5|0|What sort of request would that be? Is not that which occurs in life more than that which is held in the judgment of death?
CJ|0|103|6|0|I would say that you should be quite happy and should not mourn because it is that way!
CJ|0|103|7|0|Whosoever loves, does he love in the heart or in the head?
CJ|0|103|8|0|But you have drawn your marriage-laws not from the heart, but only from the head!
CJ|0|103|9|0|'Now life is only in the heart and goes from it into all parts of man and therewith also into the head, which has no life in itself, but is dead.
CJ|0|103|10|0|And since you already sanction the laws of the head with death - when these are dead along with the head - how much more' fitting it is to respect the living, eternal laws of the heart!
CJ|0|103|11|0|Therefore rejoice that I, as the living One among you, hold fast to the laws of life. If I did not do so, eternal death would already have come over all of you long ago!
CJ|0|103|12|0|'That is why I came into the world, that through Me all of the works and laws of death will be destroyed and be replaced by the ancient laws of life!
CJ|0|103|13|0|And if I show you in advance what the laws of life as well as those of death are, what harm am I doing you-thereby that you mourn thereat and are afraid of Me as if I, instead of bringing you life, had brought you death?
CJ|0|103|14|0|Oh how foolish you are! In Me the old, eternal Life has come to you, so rejoice and never be sad!
CJ|0|103|15|0|Now you, My Cyrenius, take the woman whom I give you, and you, Tullia, take the man whom I have led to you in all earnestness - from now on you shall never leave each other!
CJ|0|103|16|0|But when you will have been separated by the death of your body, then the surviving part shall be free according to outward things, but your love shall endure forever, Amen!'
CJ|0|103|17|0|These words of the small child highly amazed all of them;
CJ|0|103|18|0|and Tullia said, completely trembling with the greatest awe:
CJ|0|103|19|0|Oh, you people! This child is not a child of man, but He is the highest Godhead itself!
CJ|0|103|20|0|Because no man, but only a god can speak like this; only a god as the origin of life itself can know the laws of life and can awaken them in us!
CJ|0|103|21|0|But we humans are all dead; how could we then find the laws of life and apply them as such?
CJ|0|103|22|0|Oh, you most holy little child, only now I clearly recognize what I deeply sensed before: You are the Lord of heaven and earth from eternity! Therefore all my adoration to you!
CJ|0|104|1|1|For Every Man I Created Only One Woman
CJ|0|104|1|0|THIS NOBLE LANGUAGE on Tullia's part quite inspired Cyrenius, and he stepped over to Tullia, who was still holding the Baby upon her arms, and said to the Baby with the greatest feeling,
CJ|0|104|2|0|'O my Life, o true God of my heart - since You have already united me with this girl so graciously I, a poor sinner, also entreat You for Your blessing, to which I shall remain faithful for the rest of my life.'
CJ|0|104|3|0|And the Baby thereupon sat up and replied: 'Yes, My dear Cyrenius, you I will bless with your wife Tullia.
CJ|0|104|4|0|But that woman to whom you were wed until now, you must give her to Me for that.
CJ|0|104|5|0|For if you did not do that, you would remain in the sin of adultery before Me; for you loved the woman and still love her greatly.
CJ|0|104|6|0|But if you surrender the woman and completely give her up and sacrifice her to Me, then you have also given Me your sin.
CJ|0|104|7|0|That is why I came into the world, that I might take all sin of mankind in the world upon Myself and efface it through My Love before Its divine countenance forever! So let it be.'
CJ|0|104|8|0|At this demand Cyrenius at first hesitated somewhat, for his spouse was an extremely beautiful Greek slave whom he had bought at a high price.
CJ|0|104|9|0|He loved her very much because of her great beauty, although he had no children by her.
CJ|0|104|10|0|And although this Grecian woman was already thirty years old, she was nevertheless so beautiful that she was worshiped by the lesser pagans as a veritable Venus.
CJ|0|104|11|0|Therefore this demand was a bit steep for the good Cyrenius and he would much rather not have had it made at all.
CJ|0|104|12|0|But the Baby did not allow Himself to be swayed by this and remained adamant in His demand.
CJ|0|104|13|0|Since Cyrenius saw that the Baby would not recede from His demand in the least, he appealed to the Baby, saying,
CJ|0|104|14|0|'O my Life! See, my spouse, the beautiful Eudokia, is grown very dear to my heart and I shall miss her greatly.
CJ|0|104|15|0|Truly, if it were possible, I would rather let You have Tullia than give up the ever so beautiful Eudokia!'
CJ|0|104|16|0|At this the Baby smiled at Cyrenius and asked him: 'Do you hold Me to be a trader?
CJ|0|104|17|0|See, that I certainly am not! Or do you hold Me to be a Being that allows Himself to be bartered with concerning a spoken word?
CJ|0|104|18|0|Oh, there I will tell you this: If you said to me: Let pass away the entire visible heaven and the visible earth - I would sooner listen to you than take back one once-spoken word.
CJ|0|104|19|0|Truly I say to you: Sun, moon and stars and this earth will pass away, like a garment they will age and become nothing; but My words eternally never!
CJ|0|104|20|0|For that reason you will also promptly have Eudokia brought here and only then receive Tullia, blessed by Me.
CJ|0|104|21|0|But if you resist, I will let Eudokia die on you - and then will never give you Tullia.
CJ|0|104|22|0|For what you do you must do freely; any activity done contrary to one's free will has no value before Me.
CJ|0|104|23|0|If Eudokia dies, then you are already judged with her death and cannot become Tullia's husband any more.
CJ|0|104|24|0|But if you offer up Eudokia to Me, then you are truly free and Tullia can be your rightful wife!
CJ|0|104|25|0|But two wives you cannot have according to My order - for in the beginning only one man and one woman were created.
CJ|0|104|26|0|Therefore do as I now have spoken to you, so a judgment will not come upon you!'
CJ|0|104|27|0|These words of the Child brought Cyrenius to the sudden decision to have Eudokia brought from the city,
CJ|0|104|28|0|for he had taken her along from Tyre but allowed no one to see her, so that absolutely no one should be captivated by her great charms.
CJ|0|104|29|0|But even now he did not entrust her to anyone else than only to the oldest son of Joseph and to Maronius Pilla.
CJ|0|104|30|0|These two, accompanied by the bodyguard of Cyrenius, went over into the residence of Cyrenius and very soon brought the beautiful Eudokia into Joseph's house. Eudokia was greatly surprised at this and did not know how it came to be that Cyrenius for the first time had her brought by strange men.
CJ|0|105|1|1|Cyrenius Makes A Sacrifice
CJ|0|105|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS now saw Eudokia opposite Tullia, he found her to be considerably more beautiful than Tullia and it hurt him to part with her forever.
CJ|0|105|2|0|He therefore asked the Baby once more if he might not at least keep her as a maid and companion of Tullia.
CJ|0|105|3|0|But the Baby said: 'My Cyrenius! You can take as many maids as you like into your house,
CJ|0|105|4|0|but not Eudokia! Her you must leave here, and that because I want it that way for your own good.'
CJ|0|105|5|0|When Eudokia saw and quite plainly heard how this small, minor Child answered Cyrenius in a commanding manner,
CJ|0|105|6|0|she was horrified and exclaimed, 'But in the name of all the gods, just what is this? A minor Child commands him before whom Asia and Egypt tremble when he speaks!
CJ|0|105|7|0|And the great commander listens fearfully to the so firmly commanding Child and willingly submits according to His declaration?
CJ|0|105|8|0|As I hear, I am supposed to separate from Cyrenius, so that another one may take my place!
CJ|0|105|9|0|Oh, that will not happen as easily as this minor Child may think!
CJ|0|105|10|0|It would in fact be an utter disgrace for you, oh mighty Cyrenius, if you should actually allow yourself to be commanded by this Child. Therefore be a man and a Roman.'
CJ|0|105|11|0|When Cyrenius heard this from Eudokia, he became provoked and declared:
CJ|0|105|12|0|'Yes, Eudokia! Right now I will show you that I am a man and a Roman!
CJ|0|105|13|0|See, even if this Child whom Tullia coaxes were not of divine origin and He were to speak to me with nearly such divine wisdom, I still would do as He says.
CJ|0|105|14|0|But this Child is of the most high, divine origin, and I thus will follow Him all the more in whatever He wants of me! -
CJ|0|105|15|0|Now what would you prefer: to do what this Child of all children wants, or to die forever?'
CJ|0|105|16|0|These words of Cyrenius to Eudokia had a great effect.
CJ|0|105|17|0|To be sure, she began to weep because she now would suddenly have to give up so much splendor,
CJ|0|105|18|0|but in doing so she considered that a God's counsel just does not allow itself to be amended, and thus resigned herself to this turn of providence.
CJ|0|105|19|0|Mary now went over to Eudokia and assured her, 'Eudokia, do not mourn over this exchange!
CJ|0|105|20|0|For you gave up only a very minor splendor so you might receive another much greater one for it.
CJ|0|105|21|0|See, I am also a daughter of a king, but the royal splendor is long passed away, and see, now I am a handmaiden of the Lord, and that is a greater splendor than all the kingship of the world!'
CJ|0|105|22|0|These words had a very strong effect on Eudokia and she began to take heart in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|106|1|1|Eudokia Finds A Greater Splendor
CJ|0|106|1|0|EUDOKIA NOW ASKED MARY whence it came to be that this Baby was so full of miraculous power and of such a most high, divine nature,
CJ|0|106|2|0|and how it came to be that Cyrenius now depended so much on the words of the Baby.
CJ|0|106|3|0|To this Mary charmingly replied, 'Dear Eudokia! See, not every matter can be hurried unduly.
CJ|0|106|4|0|Each thing needs its time, and with gentle patience we get the farthest.
CJ|0|106|5|0|Once you have been with me for a while you will find out everything, but for the time being believe that this Child is greater than all the heroes and gods of Rome!
CJ|0|106|6|0|Did you not feel the great power of the storm the day before yesterday?
CJ|0|106|7|0|See, it came from the mighty hand of Him with whom Tullia still plays!
CJ|0|106|8|0|What the power of this storm did with the temples in the city it could also do with the whole earth!
CJ|0|106|9|0|Now you know enough for the time being and may not know any more for the sake of your salvation,
CJ|0|106|10|0|but when you become more versed you will also find out more.
CJ|0|106|11|0|Therefore I entreat you for your own good that you will be silent thereof to everyone, for if you talk about it you will be judged.'
CJ|0|106|12|0|These words of Mary gave Eudokia peace and she began to think a great deal by herself concerning what she had heard from Mary.
CJ|0|106|13|0|Mary now went over to Tullia, took the Baby from her arms and said to her,
CJ|0|106|14|0|'See, this my little Son has already blessed you and you will therefore be happy forever!
CJ|0|106|15|0|But over there is the poor Eudokia - she has not felt the infinite joy of the Baby's blessing. Therefore I will also lay the Baby on Eudokia's arms, so she may feel what power goes out from the Baby.'
CJ|0|106|16|0|Thereupon Mary carried the Baby over to Eudokia and said to her assuringly,
CJ|0|106|17|0|'Here, Eudokia, is my and your salvation. Take Him on your arms for a short time and experience how sweet it is to be the mother of such a Child!'
CJ|0|106|18|0|With great deference Eudokia took the Baby on her arms,
CJ|0|106|19|0|but she feared this most mysterious Child and hardly dared to stir.
CJ|0|106|20|0|And the Baby smiled and said, 'Oh Eudokia, do not be afraid of Me, for I am not your undoing but your Savior!
CJ|0|106|21|0|And in the near future you will learn to know Me better than you know Me now.
CJ|0|106|22|0|Then you will not fear Me any more, but love Me as I love you.' - These words deprived Eudokia of fear and she began to fondle and caress the Baby.
CJ|0|107|1|1|Joseph Accepts A Gift From Cyrenius
CJ|0|107|1|0|CYRENIUS NOW said to Joseph, 'Noble friend and brother! I have found my greatest good fortune in your house in every respect! Now tell me what reward you would have for yourself from me.
CJ|0|107|2|0|Oh say, how can I recompense you even in the least degree for all that you have done for me?
CJ|0|107|3|0|But do not in any case mention this villa which would surely be something too little and mean as a reward for you.'
CJ|0|107|4|0|And Joseph replied, 'Oh brother and friend, what do you take me for?
CJ|0|107|5|0|Do you think me to be a trader in good deeds who does good only for the sake of a reward?
CJ|0|107|6|0|Oh how greatly do you err if you think that about me.
CJ|0|107|7|0|See, I know nothing meaner than a paid-for benefactor and a paid-for good deed!
CJ|0|107|8|0|Truly, may I and the day and the hour be cursed when I was born if I were to take from you even one stater!
CJ|0|107|9|0|Do you therefore take your wife, the cleansed Tullia, to yourself in all good cheer. What you will do for her and many other poor souls, that I shall always consider and accept as a good reward for my deeds to you.
CJ|0|107|10|0|But please spare this house from any endowment, for what I have is enough for all of us. Of what use then is any more?
CJ|0|107|11|0|You think perhaps that I will request some sort of board money for Eudokia? - Oh, do not speak of that!
CJ|0|107|12|0|I take her in as a daughter and shall rear her in the grace of God.
CJ|0|107|13|0|Now where indeed is the father who allowed himself to be paid anything by anyone for bringing up his daughter?
CJ|0|107|14|0|I tell you, Eudokia is worth more than all the world, so there is no reward in the world which could be offered as acceptable for her.
CJ|0|107|15|0|And the great reward which I have for all my dealings, see, He now lies in the arms of Eudokia.'
CJ|0|107|16|0|When Cyrenius perceived this great unselfishness of Joseph, he was deeply stirred and asserted,
CJ|0|107|17|0|'Truly, before God and all the people of the earth you stand alone as a man of all men.
CJ|0|107|18|0|To praise you with words would be a vain effort, for you stand exalted above every word of man.
CJ|0|107|19|0|But I now know what to do so I may show you how very greatly I honor and value you.
CJ|0|107|20|0|I shall make you a present which you will surely not refuse.
CJ|0|107|21|0|See, in Tyre I have three girls and five boys from very poor parents who are deceased.
CJ|0|107|22|0|I shall have these dear children brought here to you so they may be brought up by you.
CJ|0|107|23|0|That I shall see to their upkeep you may be fully assured of.
CJ|0|107|24|0|Will you deny me that also? No, Joseph, my noble brother, that you surely will not do!'
CJ|0|107|25|0|And Joseph replied, deeply moved, 'No, brother, that I shall never deny you! Therefore send these children here as soon as possible and they shall receive the best care in everything they may need.'
CJ|0|108|1|1|A Secret Roman Marriage Law
CJ|0|108|1|0|CYRENIUS WAS quite satisfied by this assurance of Joseph and said,
CJ|0|108|2|0|'My esteemed friend, now everyone of my wishes has been fulfilled and I have nothing more that I might wish!
CJ|0|108|3|0|Only one unfortunate situation still exists beside my great good fortune, and this is as follows:
CJ|0|108|4|0|Tullia, the heavenly one, is now my rightful wife. But according to convention I am a Roman and therefore must also, for the sake of the people, have myself formally married by a priest.
CJ|0|108|5|0|Such a consecration can only be performed by a high priest of Hymen, and only then becomes a legally acceptable union.
CJ|0|108|6|0|Now how are we going to do this here since apart from the three lesser priests not one remains?'
CJ|0|108|7|0|Here Joseph suggested to Cyrenius, 'Why do you concern yourself with that which is of no consequence?
CJ|0|108|8|0|When you return to Tyre you will find enough priests who will give you their benediction for money, if you actually place any importance on this benediction.
CJ|0|108|9|0|But if you remain as you are you will do better, for you are after all also a lord above your own law.
CJ|0|108|10|0|Now I recall having once heard from a Roman that a secret law exists in Rome which reads thus:
CJ|0|108|11|0|If a man espouses a girl in the presence of a mute, a fool or a minor child,
CJ|0|108|12|0|and these are good-natured during the espousal and smile, then the marriage is quite legal, only a notice thereof must afterward be given to the priest having jurisdiction in that locality,
CJ|0|108|13|0|wherewith of course a small shining offering must not be omitted.
CJ|0|108|14|0|If this secret law is correct, what more is needed?
CJ|0|108|15|0|Let the three priests come who are staying with me. These will give you a witness that you in the presence of a Child hardly four months old which smiled at you and blessed you, espoused Tullia!
CJ|0|108|16|0|Once you have this quite innocent witness and a little gold, what more is there needed for the whole Roman people?'
CJ|0|108|17|0|At this Cyrenius actually jumped for joy and declared to Joseph,
CJ|0|108|18|0|'Indeed, my noble brother, you are quite correct. Such a law actually does exist, but at first I could not recall it.
CJ|0|108|19|0|Now everything is in the best order, so get me the three priests and I shall immediately confer with them in this matter.' - And Joseph promptly had the three still silent priests come into the chamber.
CJ|0|109|1|1|An Official Marriage Covenant
CJ|0|109|1|0|THE THREE PRIESTS came at once, and one stated, 'Only a command of the governor may loose our tongue today,
CJ|0|109|2|0|for we took an oath this morning to speak no word during this whole day and to take no bite of food.
CJ|0|109|3|0|But, as stated, we now break this oath in the evening because we are forced to do so by the order of the governor. May he one day bear the responsibility for us!'
CJ|0|109|4|0|Cyrenius retorted, 'Truly, I have not compelled you, but if your conscience bothers you in the matter then I will gladly bear the responsibility.
CJ|0|109|5|0|For I am after all in the house of Him who is ultimately concerned with such accountabilities - and there I believe that in the rendering of this account I shall not fare as badly as you foolishly imagine it.'
CJ|0|109|6|0|And Joseph said, 'Oh brother, the accounting is already completed, so just tell the three what you have to request of them.'
CJ|0|109|7|0|At this one of the priests anticipated Cyrenius and asked him what they should do for him.
CJ|0|109|8|0|And Cyrenius briefly presented his desire to the three.
CJ|0|109|9|0|Here the three affirmed, 'The law is right and so is its fulfillment, but we are only lesser priests and our witness will not be acknowledged as binding.'
CJ|0|109|10|0|And Cyrenius explained to them that because of the complete lack of a high priest, every lesser priest was then obligated to perform the official duties and administer the justice of a high priest in this instance.
CJ|0|109|11|0|The priests thereupon admitted, 'That is right, but when we were to exercise the power of high priests two days ago you condemned us!
CJ|0|109|12|0|If we now were again to exercise the prerogative of a high priest, would you then not condemn us again?'
CJ|0|109|13|0|Cyrenius now replied in a somewhat aroused manner, 'At that time I condemned you because you wanted to exercise the prerogatives of high priests quite contrary to law;
CJ|0|109|14|0|but now you have the legal right before you. If you act accordingly you certainly have no condemnation to fear on my part.
CJ|0|109|15|0|Instead I will give you an offering which shall secure your livelihood. And an offering for Rome shall not be overlooked either.'
CJ|0|109|16|0|Here the three priests said, 'Good! But we do not give allegiance to the gods any more and want nothing more to do with Rome's paganism!
CJ|0|109|17|0|Will our certificate be valid if it becomes known in Rome that we have gone over to the faith of Israel?'
CJ|0|109|18|0|And Cyrenius retorted, 'You know as well as I that in Rome every testimony is valid for money.
CJ|0|109|19|0|Therefore do what I request of you. Anything else does not concern you and I shall see that it is taken care of.'
CJ|0|109|20|0|This assurance moved the priests to make out the desired certificate for Cyrenius and to bless him therewith.
CJ|0|109|21|0|When Cyrenius had the certificate, he gave Tullia his hand and lifted her up as now his lawful wife.
CJ|0|109|22|0|Then he gave her a ring and thereupon had royal clothes brought for her from the city.
CJ|0|110|1|1|Do Not Sigh Because Of The World
CJ|0|110|1|0|IN A SHORT TIME the royal clothes were brought for Tullia and she was attired with them.
CJ|0|110|2|0|Mary took her dress, washed it and then kept it for herself again.
CJ|0|110|3|0|Cyrenius, of course, wanted to give Mary royal clothes for it also,
CJ|0|110|4|0|but Mary as well as Joseph declined this in all earnestness.
CJ|0|110|5|0|When Eudokia saw Tullia in her true regal splendor, her heart became heavy so that she secretly began to sigh.
CJ|0|110|6|0|But the Baby quietly said to her: 'Eudokia, I tell you, do not sigh because of the world, but sigh instead because of your sins and you will be better off!
CJ|0|110|7|0|See, I am more than Cyrenius and Rome. Once you have Me, then you have more than if you owned the whole world.
CJ|0|110|8|0|If you want to have Me completely, then you must repent your sin which caused you to become sterile.
CJ|0|110|9|0|If you will repent your sins in your love for Me, then only will you recognize according to the measure of your love for Me just who I actually am.
CJ|0|110|10|0|And when you do recognize Me, then you will be happier than if you were the consort of the emperor himself.
CJ|0|110|11|0|See, the emperor must maintain strong guards so he will not be driven from the throne.
CJ|0|110|12|0|But I am sufficient unto Myself alone. Spirits, suns, moons, earths and all the elements are obedient to Me - I need no guards and even allow Myself to be borne on the arms by you, notwithstanding that you are a sinner!
CJ|0|110|13|0|So be calm and do not weep, for you have received what was taken from Tullia when she received the royal garments.
CJ|0|110|14|0|And that is infinitely more than yonder kingly garments shimmering with gold, which are dead and bring death,
CJ|0|110|15|0|while you are carrying the Life on your arms and will eternally never taste death if you love Me!'
CJ|0|110|16|0|These words of the Baby had such a salutary effect on the feelings of Eudokia that she began to weep in the great joy of her blissful, sublime wonderment.
CJ|0|110|17|0|When Mary noticed that Eudokia bathed her eyes in tears of joy, she went over to her and asked,
CJ|0|110|18|0|'Gracious Eudokia, what can it be that makes me discover sweet tears in your eyes?'
CJ|0|110|19|0|And Eudokia, after a sigh of deep bliss, replied,
CJ|0|110|20|0|'Oh you most fortunate of mothers in the whole world, see, your Baby has spoken to me marvelously!
CJ|0|110|21|0|Truly, not mortal men in all their worldly eminence, but only gods can be capable of such words.
CJ|0|110|22|0|My breast is now filled with great thoughts and presentiments. As if from a hidden depth they ascend in me like bright stars out of the sea, and therefore I am crying from rapture!'
CJ|0|110|23|0|And Mary assured her, 'Eudokia, just be patient! After the stars the sun will also come, and in that light only will you behold where you are. - But now quiet, for Cyrenius is coming over.'
CJ|0|111|1|1|The World Is A Stage Of Deceit
CJ|0|111|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS with Tullia came over to Eudokia who still held the Baby on her arm, he said to the Baby,
CJ|0|111|2|0|'O my Life, o my all! To You alone do I owe this my great, wonderful happiness.
CJ|0|111|3|0|I did only little for You, and You reward me so unspeakably and make me the happiest man on earth.
CJ|0|111|4|0|Oh how shall I, a poor sinner, ever be able to thank You enough for that?'
CJ|0|111|5|0|Here the Baby sat up, raised His right hand and replied:
CJ|0|111|6|0|'O My dear Cyrenius Quirinus, I now bless you and your wife Tullia so that you shall live together happily in the world.
CJ|0|111|7|0|But I also tell you this: never consider yourself too fortunate in the happiness of the world but hold the world as well as its happiness to be a stage of deceit, and you will enjoy the life of the world in the right measure of wisdom.
CJ|0|111|8|0|See, everything in the world is exactly the opposite of what it appears to be! Only love alone, when it comes from the bottom of the heart, is just and true.
CJ|0|111|9|0|Wherever you see life without love, there is only death, not life.
CJ|0|111|10|0|But where you suppose death to be because of the repose of true love, there life dwells, and no one can destroy it.
CJ|0|111|11|0|You do not know how weak the ground is where you stand, but I know, therefore I tell you all this.
CJ|0|111|12|0|Dig here only a thousand fathoms deep, and you will have a mighty chasm before you which will devour you.
CJ|0|111|13|0|Therefore do not bore too deeply into the world, and do not rejoice at the discoveries in the depths of the world,
CJ|0|111|14|0|for wherever anyone digs too deeply into the world, he there prepares his own downfall.
CJ|0|111|15|0|Do not trust the spot where you stand, for it is infirm and can swallow you if you dig there and tunnel a mine into the ground.
CJ|0|111|16|0|Consider: Everything in the world can kill you because everything carries death within itself - only love alone does not, if you preserve it in its purity.
CJ|0|111|17|0|But if you mix it with worldly things, it becomes heavy and can also kill you in body as well as in spirit.
CJ|0|111|18|0|Hence remain in pure, unselfish love, love the one God as your Father and Creator above all things and men as your brothers like yourself, and you will have eternal life in such a love. Amen.'
CJ|0|111|19|0|These the Baby's words of superior wisdom instilled such deep respect into Cyrenius as well as all those present that they trembled all over.
CJ|0|111|20|0|Joseph then went over to Cyrenius and said, 'Brother, get hold of yourself and with the blessing of this house go into the city. But keep everything that you heard and received here hidden for the time being. And tomorrow come and keep the wedding feast here.' - Cyrenius thereupon went into the city with Tullia and his company.
CJ|0|112|1|1|Joseph's House Receives New Guests
CJ|0|112|1|0|IT WAS ALREADY late in the evening when Cyrenius with his company left Joseph's house and went into the city.
CJ|0|112|2|0|Joseph then said to his sons, 'Children, go now, and take care of our household. Provide for the cows and the donkeys, then prepare us an evening-meal and make it a good and fresh one. For today I must adopt and bless my new daughter at a joyful meal.'
CJ|0|112|3|0|Thereupon the sons of Joseph promptly did as Joseph had ordered.
CJ|0|112|4|0|But how surprised were they when they encountered several youths in white robes in the stable, who tended Joseph's livestock most industriously.
CJ|0|112|5|0|The sons of Joseph then asked them who had ordered them to do this and whose servants they were.
CJ|0|112|6|0|The youths answered, 'We are at all times servants of the Lord, and the Lord has ordered us to do this, therefore we did it.'
CJ|0|112|7|0|The sons of Joseph now asked the youths, 'Who is your Lord and where does He live? Is He perhaps Cyrenius?'
CJ|0|112|8|0|The youths replied, 'Our Lord is also yours and lives with you - but Cyrenius is not His name!'
CJ|0|112|9|0|At this the sons of Joseph supposed that this must obviously be their father himself and therefore said to the youths,
CJ|0|112|10|0|'If so, then go with us so our father, who here is the lord of this house, may know if you are really his servants.'
CJ|0|112|11|0|The youths answered, 'First milk the cows, whereupon we will go with you and present ourselves before your Lord.'
CJ|0|112|12|0|Here the sons took the milk buckets and milked three times more milk than they did before, when they had taken care of their cows ever so well.
CJ|0|112|13|0|At this they were surprised beyond measure and could not explain to themselves how it was that the cows this time gave such a great deal of milk.
CJ|0|112|14|0|When they had finished milking the cows, the youths said,
CJ|0|112|15|0|'Now that you are through with your work, let us go into the house where your and our Lord lives.
CJ|0|112|16|0|But your father has also ordered you to prepare a good evening meal. This must first be made-ready before we step into the chamber of the Lord.'
CJ|0|112|17|0|They now went quickly into the kitchen, and behold, there also were several youths who were fully occupied in the preparation of a delicious evening meal. -
CJ|0|112|18|0|By now it seemed to Joseph that the work of the sons took a bit longer than usual, so he went to see what they were doing.
CJ|0|112|19|0|But how surprised was he when he found the kitchen crowded with workers.
CJ|0|112|20|0|He at once asked the sons what in heaven's name was going on.
CJ|0|112|21|0|Here the youths answered, 'Joseph, do not be concerned, for what here is and takes place truly takes place in the name of the Lord! But let us first prepare the evening meal, then you will find out the particulars from the Lord Himself.'
CJ|0|113|1|1|The New Guests At The Lord's Table
CJ|0|113|1|0|JOSEPH NOW went directly into the living room again and told Mary and Eudokia what he had seen, and what was taking place out in the kitchen.
CJ|0|113|2|0|Mary and Eudokia were extremely surprised at this, and Mary exclaimed,
CJ|0|113|3|0|'O great God, then we just are not safe for one second from Your visitations! Hardly does the one have its foot outside the door when a hundred new ones set their feet into the room in its place!
CJ|0|113|4|0|O Lord, will you grant us no rest at all? Should we flee again and this time perhaps from the Romans? Or what will become of this appearance?'
CJ|0|113|5|0|Here Joseph said: 'Dear Mary, do not frighten yourself in vain! See, we are all wanderers in this world, and the Lord is our guide.
CJ|0|113|6|0|Wherever the Lord wants to lead us there will we also follow Him, wholly surrendered to His holy will. For He alone knows where and what is best for us.
CJ|0|113|7|0|See, you are always alarmed when the Lord sends us something new, but I am filled with joy thereat - for now I do indeed know that the Lord always provides what is best for us.
CJ|0|113|8|0|This morning the Lord sent a strong trial over me; I was very sad thereat.
CJ|0|113|9|0|But the sadness did not last long, for the one who was killed was awakened and lives!
CJ|0|113|10|0|Do the same, and it will be much more worthy of you than all your futile youthful fear and timidity.'
CJ|0|113|11|0|These words calmed Mary and she was now filled with curiosity to see the new cooks in the kitchen.
CJ|0|113|12|0|She therefore arose and wanted to go see, but in that moment the sons of Joseph, laden with foods, stepped into the room, and all the youths followed them in the highest reverence.
CJ|0|113|13|0|And when they came into the vicinity of the Baby, they suddenly fell down on their knees and worshiped Him.
CJ|0|113|14|0|And the Baby sat up and addressed the youths, saying: 'Arise, o archangels of My infinite heavens!
CJ|0|113|15|0|I have heard your request. Your love wishes to serve Me here in My lowliness also, but I, your Lord from eternity, have never needed your service.
CJ|0|113|16|0|And since your love is so great, remain here for three earth-days and serve this house. But apart from those who are here in the house, no one shall find out who you are.
CJ|0|113|17|0|Now share the evening meal with My foster-father and with her who gave Me birth and with this daughter who holds Me on her hands, with the three seekers and with My brothers.'
CJ|0|113|18|0|Thereupon the youths arose, Mary took the Baby, and all sat down at the table, intoned the song of praise with Joseph and ate and drank in utmost bliss and good cheer.
CJ|0|113|19|0|And the archangels appearing as youths wept for joy and said:
CJ|0|113|20|0|'Truly, eternities have passed under our gaze, filled with the greatest delight!
CJ|0|113|21|0|But all the most blissful eternities are outweighed by this moment in which we dine at the table of the Lord, yes at the table of His children among whom He is in all His fullness. O Lord, let us become Your children also!'
CJ|0|114|1|1|The New Order For Heaven And Earth
CJ|0|114|1|0|WHEN THE EVENING MEAL was over and all had brought the Lord a song of praise with Joseph, one of the youths said to Mary,
CJ|0|114|2|0|'Mary, o elect among the women of the earth, do you not remember me any more? Am I not he who so often played with you in the temple and always brought you something good to eat and a sweet drink?'
CJ|0|114|3|0|At this Mary was startled and replied, 'Yes, I recognize you! You are Zuriel, an archangel. But you sometimes also teased me greatly when you spoke to me but did not allow me to see you.
CJ|0|114|4|0|Sometimes I had to beg you for hours before you let me see you.'
CJ|0|114|5|0|The youth answered, 'See, o elect among mothers, that was the will of the Lord who loves you beyond measure.
CJ|0|114|6|0|And just as your heart, as the seat of love, beats constantly and pushes and teases your whole being,
CJ|0|114|7|0|so also is the way of the Lord's Love that He constantly pushes, pinches and teases His loved ones, but in just that manner molds their lives and makes them durable for eternity.'
CJ|0|114|8|0|Mary was highly pleased at this explanation and praised the great kindness of the Lord.
CJ|0|114|9|0|Here another youth also turned to Mary and said, 'O blessed maiden! Do you recognize me also? It is not much more than a year since I visited you in Nazareth.'
CJ|0|114|10|0|Mary recognized him by his words and answered, 'Yes, yes, you are Gabriel! Truly, none is like you, for you have surely brought to the earth the greatest tidings of salvation to all peoples.'
CJ|0|114|11|0|And the youth answered Mary: 'O maiden, in the first part you are mistaken! See, in the bringing to pass of the greatest act the Lord has already begun with me to make use of the littlest and least means.
CJ|0|114|12|0|Therefore I am no doubt the least and littlest in the kingdom of God, but not the greatest! To be sure, I have brought the earth the greatest and holiest tidings,
CJ|0|114|13|0|but because of that I am not as if no one were equal to me in greatness, but in fact the opposite, as I am indeed the least in the kingdom of God.'
CJ|0|114|14|0|Here Mary as well as Joseph wondered at the great humility of the youth.
CJ|0|114|15|0|At this the Baby said: 'Yes, this angel is right! In the beginning the greatest was the nearest to Me.
CJ|0|114|16|0|But he exalted himself and wanted to be equal to Me and wanted to surpass Me and therefore alienated himself from Me.
CJ|0|114|17|0|And for that reason I built heaven and earth and established the order that only the least should be nearest to Me!
CJ|0|114|18|0|Now I have chosen all lowliness of the world for Myself, therefore only those will be the greatest with Me, who like Me are the least and lowest in the world as in themselves.
CJ|0|114|19|0|So you, My Gabriel, are right in your way, and the mother is also right. And thus you are the greatest because you are the least of and in yourself.'
CJ|0|114|20|0|While the Baby was speaking these words to Gabriel, all the youths fell down on their knees and worshiped Him.
CJ|0|114|21|0|In the meantime Eudokia considered back and forth, for she did not know what to make of these more than beautiful youths.
CJ|0|114|22|0|To be sure she heard how these youths were called arch-heralds, and that from the kingdom of God - but she supposed Palestine as well as Upper Egypt to be that. She therefore asked if they were perhaps envoys.
CJ|0|114|23|0|And one of the youths replied, 'Eudokia, just be patient! See, we will remain here for three days, and in that time we will surely become better acquainted.' And Eudokia was satisfied with this and soon retired.
CJ|0|115|1|1|A Protective Watch In The Night
CJ|0|115|1|0|JOSEPH NOW SAID, 'Children and friends, it is already late in the evening and I think it is time to retire!'
CJ|0|115|2|0|The youths thereupon said, 'Yes, father Joseph, you are right. All of you who still live in your mortal bodies, go to an invigorating rest.
CJ|0|115|3|0|But we shall go out of your house and shall guard it.
CJ|0|115|4|0|For the enemy of life has cunningly learned that the Lord lives here and has resolved to murderously attack this house during the night.
CJ|0|115|5|0|That is why we are here to protect this house, and when the enemy comes he shall be badly dealt with.'
CJ|0|115|6|0|Joseph and Mary, the still awake Eudokia, the three priests and the sons of Joseph were greatly terrified at these tidings,
CJ|0|115|7|0|and Joseph asserted, 'If so, then I do not want to rest, but wake with you throughout the whole night.'
CJ|0|115|8|0|But the youths said to them, 'You may all be quite free from fear, for we are enough and also have enough power according to the will of the Lord to transform the whole creation into nothing.
CJ|0|115|9|0|How then should we be afraid of a handful of mercenary, cowardly murderers!
CJ|0|115|10|0|See, the whole matter came about because a few friends of the perished priesthood learned through the efforts of Satan that Cyrenius has become a great friend of the Jews, and that through this house.
CJ|0|115|11|0|Therefore they made a secret plot and swore to attack this house during the night and to murder everyone who is inside.
CJ|0|115|12|0|We have anticipated this plot for a long time and therefore have come to protect this house.
CJ|0|115|13|0|So be quite at ease, for tomorrow you will see how we worked for you during this night!'
CJ|0|115|14|0|When Joseph heard these faithful assurances of protection from the youths, he honored and praised God,
CJ|0|115|15|0|then first showed Eudokia her bedroom, blessed her as his daughter, and she retired.
CJ|0|115|16|0|Then Mary with the Baby went into the same room and this time took Him to bed with her.
CJ|0|115|17|0|Then the three priests also went to their room, but Joseph and the sons remained in the dining room and sat up.
CJ|0|115|18|0|The youths then went outside and encamped about the house. -
CJ|0|115|19|0|When midnight approached, the clinking of weapons was to be heard on the road from the city to the villa.
CJ|0|115|20|0|In a matter of minutes the whole house of Joseph was surrounded by three hundred armed men.
CJ|0|115|21|0|But the moment they wanted to force their way into the house, the youths arose and instantly strangled the whole band down to one man.
CJ|0|115|22|0|The one they bound and led him into a small room as evidence for the following day.
CJ|0|115|23|0|Thus Joseph's house was miraculously saved, was thereafter left in peace and was safe from any future attack.
CJ|0|116|1|1|The Reawakening Of The Mercenaries
CJ|0|116|1|0|IN THE MORNING early before sunrise there was great activity in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|116|2|0|The youths put the stable and the kitchen in order with the sons of Joseph, for many things had to be prepared for the wedding feast of Cyrenius,
CJ|0|116|3|0|Joseph himself now went outside with two of the youths, Zuriel and Gabriel, viewed the corpses and said to the two,
CJ|0|116|4|0|'What will come of this? We will surely have to bury them first before Cyrenius comes from the city.'
CJ|0|116|5|0|But the youths answered, 'Joseph, do not concern yourself with that, for it is namely the governor who must see what power dwells in your house.
CJ|0|116|6|0|So these corpses must remain until Cyrenius comes and he can then have them removed himself.'
CJ|0|116|7|0|Joseph was satisfied with this information and went into the house with the two.
CJ|0|116|8|0|As they stepped into the room, Mary was just bathing the Baby, wherewith Eudokia helped her where she could.
CJ|0|116|9|0|Hereupon the two youths remained standing in the greatest veneration with hands crossed over the breast as long as the Baby was being bathed.
CJ|0|116|10|0|When the Baby was bathed and again clothed in fresh linen, He promptly called Joseph over and stated,
CJ|0|116|11|0|'Joseph, no one shall lose his life on the land which belongs to this house!
CJ|0|116|12|0|I called you that you may take this water and save it.
CJ|0|116|13|0|When Cyrenius comes from town and sees those who were strangled, take the water and sprinkle them and they will awaken and will be brought before the state court of justice.
CJ|0|116|14|0|But first tie the hands of each corpse behind its back, so that when it awakens it will not directly take up arms and defend itself!'
CJ|0|116|15|0|When Joseph heard this, he promptly with the help of the two did what the Baby had spoken,
CJ|0|116|16|0|and when he had bound the hands of the last corpse, Cyrenius arrived in full splendor from the city with a great following.
CJ|0|116|17|0|He was horrified at the sight of these bound corpses and hastily asked what had happened here.
CJ|0|116|18|0|Joseph told him everything, then had water brought and immediately sprinkled the corpses, which thereupon arose as from a deep sleep.
CJ|0|116|19|0|Cyrenius, now wholly informed, had the resuscitated mercenaries promptly brought into the prison of the state.
CJ|0|116|20|0|When all of these, along with the one who had been left alive, were led away under strong guard, Cyrenius went into the chamber with his bride and there honored and praised the God of Israel with all his might.
CJ|0|117|1|1|Cyrenius Meets The Lord's Servants
CJ|0|117|1|0|THIS OCCURRENCE put Cyrenius into a somewhat ill humor, and he did not know how he should sentence these traitors.
CJ|0|117|2|0|He therefore went over to Joseph and discussed the matter with him, and Joseph responded,
CJ|0|117|3|0|'Be of good cheer, my brother in the Lord!
CJ|0|117|4|0|See, you surely are my greatest friend and benefactor on earth, but what good would all your friendship have done me last night?
CJ|0|117|5|0|These hired assassins could have fried me over hot coals during the night along with my whole house without you having learned anything about it until this morning, when you would not have found anything left of me when you came!
CJ|0|117|6|0|Who was my Deliverer there? Who had already seen through the plans of these villains long ago and sent me help at the right time?
CJ|0|117|7|0|See, it was the Lord, my God and your God! - So be of good cheer, for you also are now in the all-protecting hand of the Lord, and He will not permit any harm to befall you!'
CJ|0|117|8|0|With heartfelt gratitude Cyrenius thanked Joseph for this consolation while at his side Tullia occupied herself with the Baby.
CJ|0|117|9|0|But at that moment he saw the two magnificent youths, and also noticed that several others like them were present in the kitchen.
CJ|0|117|10|0|He therefore asked Joseph whence these ever so beautiful and very delicate youths were and whether they also belonged to those who were rescued from the ruins.
CJ|0|117|11|0|Joseph answered, 'See, every lord has his servants; now you surely know that my little Child is a Lord also!
CJ|0|117|12|0|See, these are His servants - they are also the ones who protected this house from destruction last night.
CJ|0|117|13|0|But do not guess what country they are from, for there you will accomplish nothing since these helpers are endowed with indescribable strength and power!'
CJ|0|117|14|0|Therefore they won't tell you this, and you won't succeed against them with force because they are too powerful and infinitely strong!
CJ|0|117|15|0|Cyrenius inquired, 'Then they are half-gods, as we have them in our mythical doctrine?
CJ|0|117|16|0|What? Can it be that beside the one God you also have such half-gods whose work it is to render good services to men as well as to the main God?'
CJ|0|117|17|0|And Joseph assured him,'Oh brother, there you are greatly mistaken! See, half-gods are eternally out of the question with us,
CJ|0|117|18|0|but we do believe in highly advanced spirits who are now angels of God, but also once lived on earth as we do now!
CJ|0|117|19|0|But be as silent about what you have now learned from me as if you had never heard anything about it - or you could have to suffer much because of it.'
CJ|0|117|20|0|Here Cyrenius laid his finger on his mouth and swore to be silent until his death.
CJ|0|117|21|0|At this the two youths went over to Cyrenius and said, 'Now come outside with us, so we may show you our power.'
CJ|0|117|22|0|Cyrenius went outside with them, and behold, a mountain in the far distance disappeared at a word from the mouth of the youths!
CJ|0|117|23|0|Only then did Cyrenius grasp the reason why he had to be silent, and he also was silent throughout his whole life - and so were all who were with him.
CJ|0|118|1|1|God's Love For His Children
CJ|0|118|1|0|AFTER THIS DEMONSTRATION of power the two youths again led Cyrenius into the room where Joseph, Mary with the Baby, Tullia, Eudokia and the three priests, Maronius and other members of the part of Cyrenius were.
CJ|0|118|2|0|Joseph thereupon went over to Cyrenius and asked him,
CJ|0|118|3|0|'Well, most illustrious brother and friend, what do you say to these servants of the Lord?'
CJ|0|118|4|0|Here Cyrenius declared, 'Oh most esteemed brother, there is hardly any difference between them and the Lord, for they are just as powerful as He!
CJ|0|118|5|0|The Baby recently destroyed the great pillar of Zeus with the wave of one hand;
CJ|0|118|6|0|but these servants destroyed a whole mountain with one word! - Tell me, what difference is there then between Lord and servant?'
CJ|0|118|7|0|And Joseph answered Cyrenius: 'Oh friend, there is an infinitely great difference there!
CJ|0|118|8|0|See, the Lord does all of that from Himself eternally, but His servants are able to do that from the will of the Lord only then, when He wants it!
CJ|0|118|9|0|If that is not the case, then they are as little able to do anything of themselves as I and you, and all their own power may not crush even a mote in a sunbeam.'
CJ|0|118|10|0|Cyrenius answered, 'I understand - what you have said is correct and requires no further clarification.
CJ|0|118|11|0|But if the Lord alone effects all of that and the servants have no power of themselves, what use then are they to Him?'
CJ|0|118|12|0|Here Joseph said, 'See, my dear, splendid brother, here is the Baby! Turn to Him with your question - He will give you the best answer in the matter."
CJ|0|118|13|0|This Cyrenius did, whereupon the Baby sat up and said,
CJ|0|118|14|0|'Cyrenius, you are now a husband and last night you already begat an offspring with your wife!
CJ|0|118|15|0|And I tell you that you will have twelve of them altogether! Now when you are a father of twelve children, tell Me, of what use will they be to you, and why and for what purpose you want to have children anyway?
CJ|0|118|16|0|Can you not after all attend to your business well and vigorously enough without them?'
CJ|0|118|17|0|At this Cyrenius was greatly taken aback and after a while said somewhat at a loss,
CJ|0|118|18|0|'As far as my attending to matters of governing the state is concerned, that requires wisdom and experience, and I do not need children for that.
CJ|0|118|19|0|Only in my heart there expresses itself a powerful want for the possession of children, and this want is named love!'
CJ|0|118|20|0|The Baby continued, 'Good, but when you have children, will you not take them into your calling out of pure love for them and give them power and influence simply because they are your children, and make them your powerful servants?'
CJ|0|118|21|0|Cyrenius answered, 'O Lord, that I shall most certainly do!'
CJ|0|118|22|0|And the Baby affirmed once more: 'See, if you as a human being already do this out of love for your children, why then should God not do it as a holy Father with His children out of His infinite love for them?'
CJ|0|118|23|0|This answer told Cyrenius everything, and filled him and all those present with the greatest reverence, and he afterward asked no more.
CJ|0|119|1|1|The Wedding Garments Of The Lord's Servants
CJ|0|119|1|0|THE SONS of Joseph now came into the room and said to him, 'Father, the morning meal is plentifully prepared.
CJ|0|119|2|0|If you wish, we will set the big dining table and then serve the meal.'
CJ|0|119|3|0|Joseph said, 'Good, my children, do that, but put on your new clothes, for this morning we will observe the wedding meal of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|119|4|0|You must also be at the table, therefore you must be dressed as befits a wedding. Go now, and do what is right and proper.'
CJ|0|119|5|0|The sons then set the table and did as Joseph had ordered.
CJ|0|119|6|0|At this the two youths went over to Joseph and asked,
CJ|0|119|7|0|'Father Joseph, what do you say? See, the garment which we are wearing is only our work-garment; should we also put on a wedding-garment?'
CJ|0|119|8|0|Joseph answered, 'You are angels of the Lord and this your garment is the most beautiful wedding-garment already - so why should you put on another?'
CJ|0|119|9|0|The youths replied, 'See, we do not wish to cause anyone annoyance, and what you have ordered your sons to do we also want to do and want to be present at your table in our wedding-garments.
CJ|0|119|10|0|So let us go out, that we may change garments as do your sons.'
CJ|0|119|11|0|And Joseph said, 'Then do what you feel compelled to do from the Lord! You are after all servants of the Lord at all times, so act accordingly.'
CJ|0|119|12|0|The two youths now left the room, and in a short time they returned with the sons of Joseph and all the other youths in garments shining as brightly as the dawn in its most beautiful red glow,
CJ|0|119|13|0|and their faces, feet and hands shone like the sun when it rises.
CJ|0|119|14|0|Cyrenius and his entire party took fright at this infinite glory and majesty.
CJ|0|119|15|0|And Cyrenius protested to Joseph in anxious haste,
CJ|0|119|16|0|'Truly exalted friend, I have now seen the boundless glory of your house! But let me go outside, for this glory consumes me.
CJ|0|119|17|0|Why after all did you have to order your sons to change clothes? Without them the Lord's servants also would surely have remained in their former to me so pleasing simplicity and lack of lustre.'
CJ|0|119|18|0|At this Joseph got hold of himself, for he had also lost his breath at all the lustre, and ordered his sons to put on their work-clothes again.
CJ|0|119|19|0|This the sons did, and the youths also went, changed their garments and then returned with the sons of Joseph in their former simplicity.
CJ|0|119|20|0|At this Cyrenius felt greatly relieved and was now able to take his place at the table with his wife and his companions.
CJ|0|119|21|0|He occupied the upper part of the table with his company, and Joseph, Mary with the Baby, Eudokia, the sons of Joseph and the youths sat at the lower part of the table and all ate and drank after Joseph's hymn of praise.
CJ|0|119|22|0|But a few centurions as well as the garrison-commander supposed that they now were bodily at the table of the gods in Olympus and could not contain themselves for joy; for they knew nothing of Joseph's house and how it was constituted.
CJ|0|120|1|1|How The Easter Holidays Should Be Kept
CJ|0|120|1|0|AFTER THE COMPLETION of the delicious morning meal which lasted for an hour, the hymn of praise was spoken by Joseph and all arose from the table.
CJ|0|120|2|0|Since it was the day before the Sabbath or the Friday before the Easter Sabbath of the Jews, Joseph was a bit afraid and did not know how he was to observe these holidays here among all these Romans.
CJ|0|120|3|0|For he knew that the Romans would on this occasion also visit him on the Easter Sabbath day just like on any other day.
CJ|0|120|4|0|Therefore he was, as stated, afraid as to how he would be able to keep this exceptionally high Sabbath holy.
CJ|0|120|5|0|As he was thus thinking, the youths gathered round about him and said: 'Listen to us, you just but vainly concerned man!
CJ|0|120|6|0|You know that at about this time the angels of God also arrived in Jerusalem as archangels, Cherubim and Seraphim.
CJ|0|120|7|0|And the Holy of Holies was constantly inhabited by them as you know, and as your wife knows.
CJ|0|120|8|0|Since you know that we wait only upon the Lord and not the temple in Jerusalem, so also are we not in the temple.
CJ|0|120|9|0|When the Lord dwelt in the temple at Jerusalem, then we were also in the temple.
CJ|0|120|10|0|But now He dwells here, and we are also here to celebrate Easter with you and not one of us is in the temple which is now altogether forsaken!
CJ|0|120|11|0|Now how will you celebrate Easter better than if you act like we do?
CJ|0|120|12|0|See, we shall do the same tomorrow as we have done today and shall continue doing so, and that will be the right thing.
CJ|0|120|13|0|You do the same, and you will observe the Sabbath and the Easter holidays correctly with us in the fullest presence of the Lord of the Sabbath and all holidays.
CJ|0|120|14|0|Ask the most sublime Baby, and He will tell you the same and make this known to you with the greatest certainty.'
CJ|0|120|15|0|And Joseph asked, 'Everything you say is good and true, but what about the Law of Moses? Does this cease?'
CJ|0|120|16|0|The youths retorted, 'Just man, you are mistaken; say, did Moses ever decree the Easter holidays to be held at Jerusalem?
CJ|0|120|17|0|Did he not decree the holiday to be held only there, where the Lord is with the Ark of the Covenant?
CJ|0|120|18|0|See, now the Lord is no more with the Ark of the Covenant, but He is with you and with your house bodily!
CJ|0|120|19|0|Now say, just where according to Moses should the Easter holidays rightfully be kept?'
CJ|0|120|20|0|Here Joseph agreed, 'If that is the way it is, then of course the holidays must be observed here! But what shall we do with the many pagans here?'
CJ|0|120|21|0|And the youths answered, 'O just son of David, do not concern yourself with that, but do what we do and everything will be all right.'
CJ|0|120|22|0|Here the Baby wanted Joseph's attention (on which occasion the youths fell on their faces) and said:
CJ|0|120|23|0|'Joseph, as today, so tomorrow and the day after tomorrow; but do not be concerned because of the uncircumcised, for these are now better than the circumcised!
CJ|0|120|24|0|See, the circumcision of the foreskin is of no importance, but the circumcision of the heart is of the greatest importance!
CJ|0|120|25|0|Now these Romans have a noble heart, so I am now keeping the Easter holidays with them, and not with the Jews.'
CJ|0|120|26|0|These words again composed Joseph and he was filled with joy and turned all concern for the Easter holidays over to the youths.
CJ|0|121|1|1|An Easter Invitation From Cyrenius
CJ|0|121|1|0|AFTER THE CELEBRATION of Easter had been thus decided upon and Joseph had been put at his ease,
CJ|0|121|2|0|Cyrenius went over to Joseph and said, 'Exalted friend and brother, see, today I was your guest and shall remain so until this evening,
CJ|0|121|3|0|but tomorrow I shall prepare a little celebration in my fortress and want to invite your whole house as it is gathered here,
CJ|0|121|4|0|and I hope that you will not refuse me this act of friendship!
CJ|0|121|5|0|For I do not invite you to pay you back but I do it out of the great love and respect in which I hold your whole house.
CJ|0|121|6|0|See, for that reason I have set my departure for the day after tomorrow and cannot remain here as long as I had originally intended.
CJ|0|121|7|0|For pressing matters of state have forced me to revise my plan.
CJ|0|121|8|0|But for just that reason I would for once like to have the good fortune of showing you my hospitality, and that surely in a manner worthy of you.'
CJ|0|121|9|0|At this Joseph was taken aback again and did not know what to do, for he had the holy Easter Sabbath before him, which he at least wanted to observe in his house.
CJ|0|121|10|0|He therefore said to Cyrenius, 'Most worthy friend and brother in the Lord!
CJ|0|121|11|0|See, tomorrow is the most important holiday with us Jews which every Jew must celebrate at least within the entrance hall of his house, if indeed he is unable to travel to the temple in Jerusalem.
CJ|0|121|12|0|I would have to remonstrate most bitterly with myself if I were to violate this foremost of our laws,
CJ|0|121|13|0|so I can really promise you nothing in this respect.
CJ|0|121|14|0|But if you want to come to me and celebrate your approaching banquet in my house which actually belongs to you, I would be greatly pleased with that.'
CJ|0|121|15|0|And Cyrenius asked: 'But brother, are you then less believing than I, a pagan from birth according to your words?
CJ|0|121|16|0|What is your Child? Is He not the Lord, from whom all your laws are from the beginning?
CJ|0|121|17|0|Are the youths not His servants from time immemorial? Does He not have the right to determine the laws who so almightily rests on the arms of the young mother?
CJ|0|121|18|0|What if He should grant my request - would you still hold your holiday to be higher than His divine word?'
CJ|0|121|19|0|Here the Baby sat up and stated: 'Yes, Cyrenius, you have spoken correctly, but just keep everything to yourself.
CJ|0|121|20|0|Tomorrow we will all be your guests and where I am, there also is the true Easter. For I am the Deliverer of the children of Israel out of Egypt!'
CJ|0|121|21|0|When Joseph heard this, he forgot his Easter and accepted the invitation of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|122|1|1|A Secret Hope For The Condemned
CJ|0|122|1|0|AFTER THE KEEPING of the Easter holidays had thus been decided upon - as already mentioned - to Joseph's satisfaction, he again asked Cyrenius how matters stood with the removal of the rubble of the temple as well as with the corpses exhumed therefrom.
CJ|0|122|2|0|Cyrenius replied, 'Oh my esteemed brother and friend, do not be in the least concerned about that,
CJ|0|122|3|0|for I have already seen to the matter.
CJ|0|122|4|0|The rubble has been removed to the last stone, the mangled priests buried, and those who were restored I shall take along to Tyre the day after tomorrow and there attend to their proper disposition.
CJ|0|122|5|0|See, that is how this matter stands! I believe it has been attended to well and justly.'
CJ|0|122|6|0|Joseph agreed, 'Yes, truly, even a father could not have cared for his own children any better. I am wholly satisfied.
CJ|0|122|7|0|But what will you do with the rabble who last night attacked my house?'
CJ|0|122|8|0|And Cyrenius answered, 'See, they are guilty of high treason and by that have drawn the death penalty upon themselves.
CJ|0|122|9|0|Now you know that I am not in favor of the spilling of blood but am altogether opposed to it.
CJ|0|122|10|0|Therefore I have remitted them the death penalty and have determined that their well-deserved punishment shall be lifelong slavery!
CJ|0|122|11|0|I believe this punishment in place of the death penalty is not too great, especially if the opportunity of being freed is secretly given to him who wholly reforms.
CJ|0|122|12|0|Hence they are being taken along to Tyre, where further disposition will be made of them.'
CJ|0|122|13|0|Here Joseph said, 'Dear brother, there also you have acted quite according to the divine order, and I can only praise you for it as a truly wise governor!
CJ|0|122|14|0|But now I have one more thing on my heart. There still are the three lesser priests; what shall be done with them according to your counsel?'
CJ|0|122|15|0|Cyrenius replied, 'Oh noble friend and brother, I have also provided for them.
CJ|0|122|16|0|Maronius, who now thinks as I do, will take them into his service and will use them as his civil servants in that office to which I shall assign them.
CJ|0|122|17|0|Tell me, is it all right that way? - Truly, if my insight were greater I could surely make still better decisions.
CJ|0|122|18|0|But as it is, I act as it seems best to me and think that your God and mine will no doubt bless my good will even if it does not proceed from the best insight.'
CJ|0|122|19|0|Joseph assured him, 'The Lord has already blessed your insight as well as your will, and you therefore have already made the best decisions!
CJ|0|122|20|0|But now one thing more: How long will it be until you send me the eight children which you said consisted of five boys and three girls'?'
CJ|0|122|21|0|And Cyrenius promised,'My brother, my friend, that will be my first concern as soon as I arrive in Tyre.
CJ|0|122|22|0|But now let us visit the neighboring countryside, for today is an exceptionally friendly day, and there we will praise our Lord!' And Joseph at once set the entire house in motion in this behalf.
CJ|0|123|1|1|A Treacherous Path Up A Holy Mountain
CJ|0|123|1|0|CYRENIUS with his company, Maronius and the three priests and Joseph with Mary and with the Baby, the two youths and Eudokia made up the party.
CJ|0|123|2|0|Mary and Eudokia sat on the two donkeys which were led by the two youths.
CJ|0|123|3|0|The other youths remained at home with the sons of Joseph and helped them take care of the household, baked a good bread and prepared a noon meal, which as it turned out was not consumed until evening.
CJ|0|123|4|0|Close to the city there rose a mountain which was overgrown with cedars and measured about four hundred fathoms high.
CJ|0|123|5|0|This mountain was honored by the pagans as a holy place, therefore no trees were felled on it.
CJ|0|123|6|0|Only a path that the priests had laid out led to the summit where an open temple was erected, from which a distant and enchanting view was to be had in all directions.
CJ|0|123|7|0|Because of the thick afforestation of this fairly extensive mountain a multitude of wild animals constantly dwelt in its dense woods, which made any ascent formidable and dangerous.
CJ|0|123|8|0|The three priests were well informed of this characteristic of the mountain, so they went over to Cyrenius when he reached the foot of the mountain and made this known to him.
CJ|0|123|9|0|And Cyrenius said, 'You can plainly see that I am not afraid!
CJ|0|123|10|0|And why should I be? After all, the Lord of all the heavens and all worlds is right among us with two of His almighty servants.'
CJ|0|123|11|0|The priests took courage at the words of Cyrenius and stepped back again, and the procession went rapidly uphill.
CJ|0|123|12|0|When the entire party had penetrated deep into the mountain forest after a good half hour's march, three powerful lions suddenly sprang from the thicket of the forest and barred the way for Cyrenius.
CJ|0|123|13|0|At this Cyrenius was considerably frightened and shouted for help.
CJ|0|123|14|0|Immediately the two youths stepped up, threatened the three beasts, and these while roaring instantly left the spot;
CJ|0|123|15|0|but instead of fleeing back into the thicket they accompanied the procession on the edge of the path and harmed no one in the least.
CJ|0|123|16|0|When the company had gone onward for another half hour, a whole caravan of lions and panthers and tigers came towards them.
CJ|0|123|17|0|But when this sinister caravan beheld the two youths, it parted to both sides of the way and thus made room for the party.
CJ|0|123|18|0|Many in the party belonging to the company of Cyrenius were so filled with awe and respect at this encounter that they hardly dared to breathe.
CJ|0|123|19|0|And when they noticed how the beasts sank down and quaked as the Baby came near them, it began to dawn on these fearful pagans and they had a presentiment of who dwelt in the Child.
CJ|0|124|1|1|A Poisonous Encampment At The Summit
CJ|0|124|1|0|THE CARAVAN of beasts did not turn back, but continued on its way while slightly growling.
CJ|0|124|2|0|Eudokia at the side of Mary, as well as Tullia at the side of Cyrenius who now walked closely in front of the two donkeys, did indeed fall into a slight faint at the sight;
CJ|0|124|3|0|but Joseph and Mary instilled enough courage into them that they soon lost all sense of fear.
CJ|0|124|4|0|And the procession again went onward unhindered and now encountered no more delay on its way to the summit.
CJ|0|124|5|0|When they arrived at the summit - which was an enchanting open space, at the highest spot of which stood a temple - a new obstacle arose.
CJ|0|124|6|0|In the vicinity of the temple was a virtual encampment of the most poisonous rattlesnakes and vipers.
CJ|0|124|7|0|They sunned themselves by the hundreds on the wide open space around the temple.
CJ|0|124|8|0|When this vermin beheld the approaching party, it began to rattle, to hiss and to whistle.
CJ|0|124|9|0|Thereat the company of Cyrenius became quite rigid with fear. Tullia, who went on foot, was especially affected, lost her presence of mind altogether and here saw her doom before her eyes in her great fear.
CJ|0|124|10|0|Thereupon not only the people, but also the three lions began to give out sounds of fear and pressed themselves as closely against the people as possible.
CJ|0|124|11|0|Cyrenius in fact was not affected by this sight, but he was disturbed because of his wife and his company.
CJ|0|124|12|0|He therefore turned to Joseph and appealed, 'Brother, tell the two servants of the Lord that they shall threaten this vermin.'
CJ|0|124|13|0|At this Joseph said, 'That is not necessary!
CJ|0|124|14|0|See, my wife has all the skill in the world here. We need only let her come forward on her donkey,
CJ|0|124|15|0|and you will see how this vermin will take flight before her.'
CJ|0|124|16|0|And Mary with the Baby on her arm came forward on her donkey - and when the beasts saw her
CJ|0|124|17|0|they suddenly fled as quick as lightning and not one was to be seen anywhere.
CJ|0|124|18|0|At this the entire company was astonished and many asked in great surprise among themselves,
CJ|0|124|19|0|'Could she possibly be even Hygeia, whom all serpents are also supposed to have obeyed at a glance?'
CJ|0|124|20|0|Here Cyrenius, who heard these questions, asserted, 'What are you saying about Hygeia, who never was?
CJ|0|124|21|0|Here is more than Juno, who never was either - it is the by the most high God chosen wife of this most eminent wise man!'
CJ|0|124|22|0|At these words all in the company of Cyrenius were startled, but no one dared to inquire further of anyone else in the matter.
CJ|0|125|1|1|An Old Temple Collapses
CJ|0|125|1|0|WHEN THE SUMMIT of this mountain had thus been cleansed of all the vermin, Cyrenius said to his attendants,
CJ|0|125|2|0|'Go into the temple and sweep it, cover the altar with clean cloths and lay the brought-along foodstuffs on it.
CJ|0|125|3|0|We will then take a little nourishment in this temple with its beautiful view.'
CJ|0|125|4|0|At this the attendants of Cyrenius went and did as they had been told.
CJ|0|125|5|0|When everything was put in order, Cyrenius invited Joseph and Mary to follow him into the observation temple, to there partake of a little nourishment and refreshment.
CJ|0|125|6|0|Just then Joseph warned, 'Brother, I tell you, let everything be hurriedly brought out of the temple, otherwise it will collapse before you have brought your things out.
CJ|0|125|7|0|See, this building is already extremely old, weather-beaten and loosely held-together and once served the priests in committing great iniquities!
CJ|0|125|8|0|That is why it now is only being held together by a few evil spirits.
CJ|0|125|9|0|If I and my wife and the Baby now step into this loosely held-together structure, the evil spirits will flee, and the whole temple will collapse on our heads in dusty ruins.
CJ|0|125|10|0|I therefore beg you, follow my advice and you will fare well!'
CJ|0|125|11|0|Cyrenius made big eyes at this but nevertheless immediately followed Joseph's advice.
CJ|0|125|12|0|And his attendants had barely completed this task, albeit in great haste, when a great swarm of black flies was seen fleeing the temple amid a wild, massive buzz.
CJ|0|125|13|0|At this appearance Joseph called to the servants, 'Get out of the temple in all haste or you will suffer harm!'
CJ|0|125|14|0|As if seized by a gale the servants of Cyrenius rushed out of the temple at Joseph's call.
CJ|0|125|15|0|And when in greatest haste they were hardly a few steps away from the temple, it already collapsed amid a great, thunderous crash.
CJ|0|125|16|0|All were horrified and struck their hands together over their heads, and even the three trusty lions ran a short distance away on this occasion but returned after a little while.
CJ|0|125|17|0|Everyone inquired of everyone else why this happened, but among the pagans - with the exception of Cyrenius - no one could give an answer.
CJ|0|125|18|0|When the party had recovered somewhat from its fright, Cyrenius asked Joseph where a safe place might be to set up the refreshments.
CJ|0|125|19|0|Joseph then showed him an open, green little place beneath a mountain fig tree laden with blossoms and fruits.
CJ|0|125|20|0|Cyrenius promptly sent his servants there, had the place tidied and gracefully bedecked with covers on which a variety of the brought-along refreshments were placed.
CJ|0|126|1|1|The Strange Fires In Ostracine
CJ|0|126|1|0|THEREUPON CYRENIUS again invited Joseph together with Mary, the Baby and Eudokia to partake with him of the refreshments.
CJ|0|126|2|0|At this Joseph went with his own and took place at the lower end, blessed the food and ate and drank.
CJ|0|126|3|0|The two youths also followed Joseph's example as did all the rest of the party.
CJ|0|126|4|0|When they thus sat together in good spirits and ate and drank,
CJ|0|126|5|0|behold, Maronius, who sat at the side of Cyrenius, noticed that a mighty column of smoke began to rise above the city of Ostracine,
CJ|0|126|6|0|and that on the somewhat more distant seashore thick columns of smoke also arose.
CJ|0|126|7|0|He immediately made this known to Cyrenius who quickly recognized that in the city it was none other than his own palace that stood in flames, and surmised that at the somewhat more distant seashore his ships were also set on fire.
CJ|0|126|8|0|As if stung by an asp, Cyrenius jumped up at this and cried out,
CJ|0|126|9|0|Tn heaven's name - what must I see! Are those the fruits of my kindness to you miserable Ostracines?
CJ|0|126|10|0|Truly, I will transform this kindness into the fury of a tiger and you shall suffer for this outrage as none of the furies has suffered in the lowest hell!
CJ|0|126|11|0|Up, friends and brothers! Now there can be no remaining here for us. Up, up to righteous revenge against these evil-doers!'
CJ|0|126|12|0|The entire company of Cyrenius sprang up at this terrible call as rapidly as lightning and suddenly gathered up everything.
CJ|0|126|13|0|Only Joseph with his own remained quite calmly seated and hardly looked toward the area of the fire.
CJ|0|126|14|0|Cyrenius noticed this and angrily addressed Joseph, saying,
CJ|0|126|15|0|'Just what kind of a friend are you to me, since you can sit here so calmly in view of my misfortune?
CJ|0|126|16|0|You know very well that I cannot traverse this mountain road safely without you because of the many wild beasts.
CJ|0|126|17|0|So arise and give me protection, or you will embitter me against you also.'
CJ|0|126|18|0|And Joseph retorted very calmly, 'See, you furious Roman, just because of that I shall not follow you.
CJ|0|126|19|0|Now what will you do if in perhaps two hours you should get down? - Will everything not have been consumed by the flames by that time?
CJ|0|126|20|0|If you want to take revenge, I would think there will be time enough for that later.
CJ|0|126|21|0|Now if you had not become so aroused, truly, I would have told the two youths and they would instantly have made an end of the fire!
CJ|0|126|22|0|But since you became so aroused, then go down by yourself and quell the fire with your anger.'
CJ|0|127|1|1|An Empty Deception By Evil Spirits
CJ|0|127|1|0|THESE QUITE seriously spoken words of Joseph made a very powerful impression on Cyrenius, and he did not know what to say thereto;
CJ|0|127|2|0|neither did he trust himself to approach the noticeably somewhat aroused man with another word.
CJ|0|127|3|0|He therefore said to Tullia, 'You go over to the wise man and explain to him my understandable distress and by it affected excitement of my feelings.
CJ|0|127|4|0|Ask him for his forgiveness, and assure him that in all the future I shall never again prepare him such a minute.
CJ|0|127|5|0|I desire only that he will not leave me this time without aid and deny me his assistance.'
CJ|0|127|6|0|Now Joseph plainly heard what Cyrenius said to Tullia;
CJ|0|127|7|0|therefore he stood up, went over to Cyrenius and said, 'Noble friend and brother in the Lord God! Until now we have not needed any go-betweens,
CJ|0|127|8|0|but have always brought any matter between us into the open.
CJ|0|127|9|0|For what then should your wife be a go-between, as if we two were not sufficient to each other?
CJ|0|127|10|0|Do you really think that I too could become angry over some matter or other?
CJ|0|127|11|0|Oh see, therein you would be greatly mistaken about me! My seriousness is only the fruit of my great love to you!
CJ|0|127|12|0|But that friend is surely a poor one who in time of need cannot give his friend a serious word.
CJ|0|127|13|0|See, if there were anything to the matter which now gives you such great concern, you ought to be assured that I would have been the first to call your attention to it, as I have so often done at every opportunity.
CJ|0|127|14|0|But here is nothing more than a wholly empty deception on the part of those evil spirits who were driven away from here.
CJ|0|127|15|0|They are now taking a blind revenge and want to disquiet us because we drove them from their old nest here.
CJ|0|127|16|0|See, that is all there is to it! - If you had asked me sooner, before you became excited, you would not even have had to arise from the ground.
CJ|0|127|17|0|But you immediately trusted your senses and became excited for nothing about nothing.
CJ|0|127|18|0|But now just sit down again wholly at ease and look at the fire in a relaxed frame of mind, and be assured that it will soon come to an end.'
CJ|0|127|19|0|This information was something quite from another world for Cyrenius;
CJ|0|127|20|0|but for all that he believed what Joseph had told him although he understood nothing in the matter.
CJ|0|127|21|0|And Joseph said to the youths in the presence of Cyrenius,
CJ|0|127|22|0|'Do you also look once toward the spot where those driven away from here carry on their wantonness, so an end may be made thereof for my brother's piece of mind.'
CJ|0|127|23|0|And the two did so - and behold, in an instant no trace of the fire was to be seen!
CJ|0|127|24|0|Only now did Cyrenius have a somewhat better idea of what Joseph had told him before and he came into a tremendous respect of the two youths as well as of Joseph.
CJ|0|128|1|1|Joseph Discourses On The Wonders Of Creation
CJ|0|128|1|0|AFTER PEACE and order had thus been restored all around, the Baby sat up and said to Cyrenius:
CJ|0|128|2|0|'Listen to me, you noble-hearted man! Do you still recall how I pulled My brother James by the hair?
CJ|0|128|3|0|See, then you wanted Me to pull your hair also.
CJ|0|128|4|0|I promised you that, and see, now I am already keeping My promise;
CJ|0|128|5|0|for all the little surprises which have since come your way are nothing else than the promised hair pullings.
CJ|0|128|6|0|And when these come and are again sent your way in the future, then remember these My words and fear nothing and never become angry.
CJ|0|128|7|0|For you will not lose a hair by it. To whom I do this, him I love, and he has nothing to fear whether in this or in the other world.'
CJ|0|128|8|0|The tears came to Cyrenius' eyes at this explanation of the Baby, and he could not help himself for sheer love and gratitude.
CJ|0|128|9|0|Many of the bystanding pagans also heard these words of the Baby and were surprised beyond all measure how it was possible for this Baby of three months to speak with such perfect wisdom and great clarity.
CJ|0|128|10|0|A few turned to Joseph and asked how it happened to be that this Baby was able to speak so perfectly at such an early age.
CJ|0|128|11|0|At this Joseph shrugged his shoulders and said: 'Dear friends! All over the earth, and especially in the realm of life, the greatest wonders may be seen here and there.
CJ|0|128|12|0|They do in fact take place before our very eyes, but who can determine the secret laws of a creating Deity by which He effects these things?
CJ|0|128|13|0|Truly, we as ourselves the greatest wonders tread countless wonders daily with our feet - and hardly notice them!
CJ|0|128|14|0|Now which of us knows how these countless wonders of creation come into being - how the grass, how the tree, how the worm, how the gnat, how the fish in the water?
CJ|0|128|15|0|Truly, nothing remains there for us than to behold the wonders and to praise, honor and worship their great and holy Master Builder.'
CJ|0|128|16|0|This explanation of Joseph put the inquiring pagans completely at ease,
CJ|0|128|17|0|and from this moment they looked at all of nature with altogether different eyes.
CJ|0|128|18|0|They then dispersed to all sides of the mountain clearing and observed the wonders of creation.
CJ|0|128|19|0|And Cyrenius secretly turned to Joseph and asked him if he really did not know more here than he had told.
CJ|0|128|20|0|Of this Joseph assured him and advised, 'Turn to the Baby in this matter - He will surely give you the best explanation.'
CJ|0|129|1|1|He Is The Image Of The Invisible God
CJ|0|129|1|0|AND CYRENIUS in all humility turned directly to the Baby and inquired,
CJ|0|129|2|0|'O my Life, my all! See, even though one knows who You are, it is still too unheard-of and wonderful that You, a Baby of three months, are able to speak ever so perfectly and wisely.
CJ|0|129|3|0|I would like to be enlightened a little in this matter by You on this mountain where so many wonderful things have already happened! Would You not tell me something about this?'
CJ|0|129|4|0|The Baby replied, 'See, there at Joseph's side are the two servants - turn to them and they will tell you about that.'
CJ|0|129|5|0|Cyrenius promptly followed this advice and turned to the two youths in this matter.
CJ|0|129|6|0|And these said: 'See, that is a matter pertaining only to heaven; even though we tell you about it, you still will not be able to understand it.
CJ|0|129|7|0|For natural men can never comprehend what pertains only to heaven because their spirit is not yet free, but is imprisoned by all the substance in the world.
CJ|0|129|8|0|And you also are still for the most part natural, therefore you will not grasp what we will tell you.
CJ|0|129|9|0|Now you want to be informed about it - so we will also inform you at the Lord's bidding.
CJ|0|129|10|0|But we cannot give you the understanding because you are still a natural man.
CJ|0|129|11|0|'So hear us - See, the Baby as He is in His human nature cannot speak to you for quite some time as a natural human being.
CJ|0|129|12|0|That He will be able to do only halfway in a year.
CJ|0|129|13|0|But in the Child's heart dwells the fullness of the eternal, almighty Deity!
CJ|0|129|14|0|Now when this Baby speaks audibly and most wisely to you, the to you visible Child does not speak but the Deity speaks out of the Child into your for that purpose awakened spirit.
CJ|0|129|15|0|You then become aware of the words just as if the to you visible Baby were speaking.
CJ|0|129|16|0|But this is not so, for here only the to you invisible Deity is speaking.
CJ|0|129|17|0|What you suppose is coming from outside of you, that you are hearing only within yourself, and that is the case with everyone who hears this Baby speak.
CJ|0|129|18|0|Now so you may convince yourself of that, just stand as far away from here as you like where it would not be possible to hear the Baby's natural voice any more,
CJ|0|129|19|0|and the Baby will then speak to you, and you will hear Him in the distance just as plainly as close by. Go and convince yourself of that!'
CJ|0|129|20|0|And Cyrenius, while in fact not understanding anything of the whole matter, went about a thousand steps away on the mountain plateau.
CJ|0|129|21|0|There he suddenly heard the call of the Baby quite loud and clear, which sounded as follows,
CJ|0|129|22|0|'Cyrenius, turn back again as fast as you can; for beneath the spot over which you are standing is a cave filled with tigers!
CJ|0|129|23|0|These are beginning to scent you; so hurry back before they catch sight of you!'
CJ|0|129|24|0|Upon hearing this Cyrenius immediately fled back as fast as the wind and now stood there quite bewildered. He wanted to ask further, but in the end he did not know what he actually should ask about, for this experience was just too strange to him.
CJ|0|130|1|1|Love Alone Can Comprehend The Lord
CJ|0|130|1|0|THE TWO YOUTHS now said no more, but this explanation made Cyrenius too curious to let matters rest.
CJ|0|130|2|0|After a while when he had gathered his wits again, Cyrenius asked the two youths,
CJ|0|130|3|0|'Most exalted servants of God quite surely from eternity! Your explanation is too wonderfully sublime and attracts all that is alive in me to such an extent that I cannot be content with what you have told and shown me!
CJ|0|130|4|0|I now do indeed fully perceive that I am a natural man of worldly intellect, wholly devoid of all higher wisdom, who sees hardly the span of a hand farther than he can reach;
CJ|0|130|5|0|but should it not be possible to provide me with a little more insight?
CJ|0|130|6|0|I therefore ask you most humbly to do this for me! Open for me a greater ability to comprehend which is surely hidden within me,
CJ|0|130|7|0|so I might at least understand what you have told me more plainly.'
CJ|0|130|8|0|The pair replied: 'See, you otherwise so dear friend and brother, here you ask for something that is impossible before its time.
CJ|0|130|9|0|For as long as you still walk in the flesh, you can never comprehend matters of the highest divine wisdom.
CJ|0|130|10|0|Consider the Lord God, who here dwells in this Baby in all of His infinite and eternal fullness, to have countless myriads of most glorious and gigantic worlds and earths, the infinitely smallest part of which you see in the nighttime as little stars in the sky,
CJ|0|130|11|0|which He could have chosen for His incarnation as He did this earth! And despite this He has chosen this meager earth which, in fact, is the most miserable and inferior among all the countless spheres in every respect.
CJ|0|130|12|0|But thus it has pleased Him, the eternal Lord of infinity, to do - He did it, as is manifest before our eyes.
CJ|0|130|13|0|Now do you suppose that He needed either our counsel or our agreement for that?
CJ|0|130|14|0|See, that would be a basically false thought! He does what He wants alone from eternity, and never has anyone been His counselor!
CJ|0|130|15|0|Now who can ask Him and say: Lord, what are You doing, and why do You do it? -
CJ|0|130|16|0|He is in Himself eternally the highest perfection, the highest wisdom, the greatest love and gentleness.
CJ|0|130|17|0|He is in Himself the only most high power and might; one thought of destruction in His breast - and everything instantly sinks back into nothing.
CJ|0|130|18|0|And behold, here He allows Himself as a weak Child of man to be coaxed on the arms of a frail Jewish maiden.
CJ|0|130|19|0|And He who provides countless suns, worlds and beings of infinite description with life-giving, most wisely appropriate nourishment most generously from eternity, does Himself here on this meager earth suck the frail breasts of a fifteen-year-old maiden.
CJ|0|130|20|0|He as the primal Life of all life has Himself put on the garment of death and of sin and has hidden Himself in flesh and blood!
CJ|0|130|21|0|Now what do you say to that? - How does that seem to you? Would you not like to have a clearer explanation of that also?
CJ|0|130|22|0|But as little as you will ever comprehend that in its full depth, just that little can any more be told you here concerning the early speaking of this most high Child!
CJ|0|130|23|0|Love Him instead with all your might, and betray Him nowhere, and you will then find something in this love which otherwise all the heavens will not be able to reveal to you in eternities.'
CJ|0|130|24|0|These words filled Cyrenius with such a tremendous respect of the Child that he immediately fell down before Him and said in tears, 'O Lord, I am eternally never worthy of such grace which I enjoy here.'
CJ|0|130|25|0|And the Baby said, 'Cyrenius, stand up, and do not betray Me. I do indeed know your heart and love you and bless you - therefore arise!' And Cyrenius promptly arose, altogether trembling from love and esteem.
CJ|0|131|1|1|The Approach Of A Great Storm
CJ|0|131|1|0|THE OTHERS, who had scattered to all sides of the widely stretched plateau of the mountain, now returned with deeply concerned expressions.
CJ|0|131|2|0|For they saw very massive, black clouds arise in the south-west part of Egypt, which are always forerunners of great storms.
CJ|0|131|3|0|In the north-east toward Ostracine all was indeed clear, but all the more gruesome did matters appear above the mountain range to the south-west.
CJ|0|131|4|0|These returnees therefore advised a rapid return homeward.
CJ|0|131|5|0|Cyrenius answered, 'When the proper time comes, our wise and mighty companions will surely tell us;
CJ|0|131|6|0|but as long as they are not concerned we too will not worry!'
CJ|0|131|7|0|At this Maronius and the garrison commander observed, 'You are right - but just go up on this little mound and look, and you will surely agree with us.
CJ|0|131|8|0|For it certainly appears as if all the furies had suddenly set the earth on fire!'
CJ|0|131|9|0|Cyrenius now asked the lightly slumbering Joseph,
CJ|0|131|10|0|'Friend and brother, did you hear what sort of a warning report these here have brought me?'
CJ|0|131|11|0|Joseph answered, 'I was slumbering and hardly know of what you were speaking among yourselves.'
CJ|0|131|12|0|And Cyrenius said, 'Then arise and go with me up this little mound, and you will immediately discover the subject of our discussion.'
CJ|0|131|13|0|Hereupon Joseph arose and went up on the mound with Cyrenius.
CJ|0|131|14|0|When they arrived there, Cyrenius showed Joseph the extremely threatening appearance of the approaching storm.
CJ|0|131|15|0|And Joseph asked, 'Well, what are you going to do now?
CJ|0|131|16|0|Flee? - Where to? The storm will be here in at least a quarter of an hour!
CJ|0|131|17|0|It will take us an hour and a half to walk to Ostracine, and before we ever get through the upper part of the forest on the mountain, the storm will have caught up with us long before!
CJ|0|131|18|0|What then in the uncertain ravine if an army of beasts encircles us - which they like to do in great storms?
CJ|0|131|19|0|And if on top of that streaming cloudbursts catch up with us and relentlessly tear us along into the lowland - what will we do then?
CJ|0|131|20|0|So we really should remain here on the top where we will at worst get wet, while we can run into all sorts of trouble in the forest!'
CJ|0|131|21|0|Cyrenius was satisfied with this advice and went back underneath the fig tree with Joseph.
CJ|0|131|22|0|But the company of Cyrenius appeared very skeptical - especially when they saw that the three lions suddenly sprang up and took flight into the forest.
CJ|0|131|23|0|Maronius himself said to Joseph, 'See, the three beasts which have attached themselves to us have surely taken protective flight in anticipation of the calamity which awaits us here! Should we not do the same?'
CJ|0|131|24|0|Here Joseph retorted: 'Man need not learn what to do from the animal, but from the Lord of nature!
CJ|0|131|25|0|Now I believe that I am more intelligent than the animal, so I shall remain and await the storm here and only set out when it is over - providing a storm comes!' With this all were satisfied for the present and remained in fearful anticipation.
CJ|0|132|1|1|Cyrenius Defies A Sea Of Fire
CJ|0|132|1|0|A QUARTER HOUR had barely passed when the peak of the mountain suddenly became enveloped in such a thick mist that it became quite dark.
CJ|0|132|2|0|The entire company of Cyrenius began to lament and complained,
CJ|0|132|3|0|'Now we have it! Zeus will really attend to us here!
CJ|0|132|4|0|Here one cannot say: Far from Zeus, far from lightning!
CJ|0|132|5|0|Instead we can all perish here miserably, for mortals should never approach too closely to the gods if they wish to walk the earth with a whole skin.'
CJ|0|132|6|0|Here Cyrenius remarked a bit jokingly, 'I do not care a rap about any of your gods, one and all!
CJ|0|132|7|0|I have found a better God, of whom it is not said: Far from Him, far from the lightning!
CJ|0|132|8|0|For here it states just the opposite: Far from Him, far from life - and very near the death-dealing lightning!
CJ|0|132|9|0|Close to Him therefore means the same as: Close to life - and very far from the death-dealing lightning.
CJ|0|132|10|0|So these mists do not frighten me in the least, for I do indeed know that we are all very far from the deadly lightning.'
CJ|0|132|11|0|Cyrenius had hardly finished speaking, when a crackling flash of lightning struck the earth right in front of the group, and was soon followed by a multitude of others.
CJ|0|132|12|0|This took Cyrenius back a bit and his companions asked, 'How do you like that in view of your former remark?'
CJ|0|132|13|0|Cyrenius answered, 'Very well, for that is a truly murderous racket which all the same has not cost any of us his life!
CJ|0|132|14|0|It seems to me that your gods here perceive the brother of the emperor - and quite Someone Else also! Therefore they do us this honor.'
CJ|0|132|15|0|Here a captain from the company of Cyrenius, who still was quite impressed with the doctrine of the gods, warned the joking Cyrenius,
CJ|0|132|16|0|'But I beg your imperial, consular highness, do not under any circumstance make fun of the gods here! For how easily could the nimble Mercury report that to Zeus - and then we would all be finished off with one bolt of lightning!'
CJ|0|132|17|0|At this Cyrenius said still more jokingly, 'My dear captain, you can be quite at ease in this matter.
CJ|0|132|18|0|Mercury has now been placed under an eternal house arrest by Zeus, and Zeus has himself received such a sound slap in the face by quite another Juno that he has lost his sight and hearing forever!
CJ|0|132|19|0|So you need not concern yourself, since Zeus will not have much to say about thunder and lightning from now on.'
CJ|0|132|20|0|Hereupon the lightning became ever more intense and the thunder quite terrible, and the captain persisted,
CJ|0|132|21|0|'Oh, your imperial, consular highness will surely regret this diatribe against the gods!'
CJ|0|132|22|0|And Cyrenius said, 'Certainly not today - perhaps tomorrow, if I have the time left over.
CJ|0|132|23|0|See. if I were to fear the gods like you and still many another fool, I would not speak so freely at this very moment under this sea of fire!
CJ|0|132|24|0|But because I just do not fear the gods any more in the least, I speak as I do.'
CJ|0|132|25|0|With that the captain was rebuffed and did not dare to say any more to the imperial highness. -
CJ|0|132|26|0|A bolt of lightning now struck directly between Joseph, Mary, and the two youths.
CJ|0|132|27|0|And the Baby sat up and commanded: 'Unmask yourself, you monster!'
CJ|0|132|28|0|At this word all the clouds suddenly fell down. - The sky became fully clear, but in contrast a mass of vermin was to be seen crawling on the ground.
CJ|0|132|29|0|And the two youths directed a glance at the ground, and the vermin fled in part toward the forest and was in part destroyed.
CJ|0|132|30|0|This act caused all who were on the mountain with Cyrenius to fall silent, for they were at a total loss to explain it.
CJ|0|133|1|1|A Roman Marvels At The Child's Power
CJ|0|133|1|0|AFTER A LONG PAUSE of boundless astonishment the garrison commander approached Cyrenius quite meekly and stated,
CJ|0|133|2|0|'Your highness! I know that these people have devoted much time to the study of nature, as a number of illustrious leaders of Rome also have.
CJ|0|133|3|0|As for me, I have always been more of a soldier than a scholar in the field of nature.
CJ|0|133|4|0|But this most singular occurrence which here took place before our eyes compels me to reflect in the matter.
CJ|0|133|5|0|Still I am unable to find any explanation other than the miraculous, which can only be explained by the remarkable power of this Jewish Child!
CJ|0|133|6|0|Should there actually be no other cause? Should there not be certain secret laws of nature, by means of which this must be effected just as surely as otherwise rain, hail and snow?
CJ|0|133|7|0|Oh give me a little light here, so I too may understand the matter a little and not have to stand here like a lost sheep.'
CJ|0|133|8|0|Here Cyrenius admitted to the commander, 'Oh friend, you have made a poor start by turning to me in this matter,
CJ|0|133|9|0|for I understand just as little about it as you do. That such surely happened according to a law is certain.
CJ|0|133|10|0|But how the law is constituted will hardly be known by anyone other than the great Lawgiver of nature.
CJ|0|133|11|0|Now whether we mortals are justified in asking the great Lawgiver how such laws are constituted - that is something which I, for one, just do not know!'
CJ|0|133|12|0|The commander continued, 'See, your highness, over there is the wise Jew with his wonderful Child and the two most remarkable youths who this morning completely upset our tranquility with their shining garments.
CJ|0|133|13|0|How would it be if we turned to them in this most remarkable matter?'
CJ|0|133|14|0|Cyrenius said, 'Try it, if you have the courage!
CJ|0|133|15|0|I am lacking in it on this occasion, for I now perceive very clearly that they are beings of quite another kind than we are.'
CJ|0|133|16|0|The commander replied, 'I would not say that I lack the courage,
CJ|0|133|17|0|but if your highness is of that opinion then I certainly will not be a party to high treason and am content with my ignorance.'
CJ|0|133|18|0|Joseph now said to Cyrenius, 'Brother, have all get ready to leave, for the sun is already inclining noticeably.'
CJ|0|133|19|0|Cyrenius did this, and in a short time the return trip began. This occurred without any hindrance, and in two hours all were back at the villa again.
CJ|0|134|1|1|The Lord Always Knows The Best Way
CJ|0|134|1|0|WHEN THEY arrived at the villa, the party was greeted in a most friendly way by the sons of Joseph and especially by the youths who remained there.
CJ|0|134|2|0|The sons then showed Joseph all they had done in the meantime and how they had faithfully carried out his wishes.
CJ|0|134|3|0|The oldest son immediately told Joseph of all the remarkable things that had taken place during his absence in the vicinity of Ostracine.
CJ|0|134|4|0|'Quite especially,' he related, 'did the sudden fire in the governor's residence frighten all the inhabitants in the city!
CJ|0|134|5|0|But when they were attempting to put out the blaze, the great fire went out all of a sudden and no trace of it was to be seen anymore.
CJ|0|134|6|0|Thereupon we suddenly noticed that the mountain was being enveloped in fiery clouds, and a thousand bolts of lightning crisscrossed each other.
CJ|0|134|7|0|At this we thought of Sinai which could well have looked like that at the time of the great revelation of God to our fathers.
CJ|0|134|8|0|We then were greatly concerned about you, but the youths reassured us and said that no one would be harmed in the least.
CJ|0|134|9|0|When the mountain was totally enveloped in fiery clouds, behold, we were greatly frightened
CJ|0|134|10|0|because three tremendous lions sprang toward us in great haste from the path leading up the mountain.
CJ|0|134|11|0|This greatly frightened us, but the youths said: Do not be afraid, for these animals seek protection in the home of Him whom all things must obey! -
CJ|0|134|12|0|And so it was! The three lions quickly went inside our wagon shed, where they are resting peacefully.
CJ|0|134|13|0|After the storm we went there with several of the youths and looked at the giant beasts,
CJ|0|134|14|0|and they arose and made signs of unmistakable submission and friendliness!'
CJ|0|134|15|0|Here Joseph responded, 'I see, my son. We have also experienced all that! You have made your story almost too long.
CJ|0|134|16|0|All of you go now and set the table, for we all need to restore ourselves, since the mountain has tired us a bit.'
CJ|0|134|17|0|The sons and the other youths now hurried into the kitchen and the dining room and in a short time put everything in the best order.
CJ|0|134|18|0|Cyrenius now observed, 'Truly, it greatly surprises me that these three beasts, instead of going into hiding in their caves, sought protection here.
CJ|0|134|19|0|Perhaps they will stay with this house and watch it faithfully as this breed of animals has done in similar circumstances.'
CJ|0|134|20|0|Joseph affirmed, 'Everything is right with me that is right and pleasing to the Lord!
CJ|0|134|21|0|But it may also be that these animals will follow you as a protection to your ship.'
CJ|0|134|22|0|And Cyrenius said,'If the Lord wishes it, then I will surely agree to it - although the Lord can also protect me without these lions!'
CJ|0|134|23|0|Here the three came forth and took their stand around Cyrenius and indicated their friendship to him.
CJ|0|134|24|0|At this Cyrenius said, 'Now that is indeed strange - you, dear brother, need only to say something and it already happens!'
CJ|0|134|25|0|And the two youths stated, 'These three animals will serve you well this very night.
CJ|0|134|26|0|For the Lord always knows what means are best suited to help anyone.
CJ|0|134|27|0|Such animals have not infrequently been in the divine service, hence they are also chosen now to serve you in a matter which awaits you. And so be it!'
CJ|0|135|1|1|A Treacherous Attack
CJ|0|135|1|0|AFTER THIS DISCUSSION the three lions again left Cyrenius and withdrew to their wagon shed.
CJ|0|135|2|0|Cyrenius still wished to discuss this appearance with Joseph, but Joseph's sons came just then and let him know that the meal was prepared and the table was set.
CJ|0|135|3|0|At this Joseph promptly invited the whole gathering to come into the dining room and to refresh themselves with food and drink.
CJ|0|135|4|0|In answer to this invitation everyone now went into the dining room and ate the blessed foods and stilled their thirst with lemon juice and water.
CJ|0|135|5|0|After the meal, which lasted for an hour, Joseph thanked God and blessed all of the guests present.
CJ|0|135|6|0|Here the Baby called Cyrenius over, and when he approached Him in the greatest humility, He said to him,
CJ|0|135|7|0|'Cyrenius, tonight you will be attacked by a small, traitorous band in your sleeping-chamber.
CJ|0|135|8|0|I am therefore sending the three lions along with you, so leave them in the chamber with you when they follow you!
CJ|0|135|9|0|When the traitorous horde enters your chamber it will suddenly be attacked by the three lions in the fiercest manner and will be torn to pieces,
CJ|0|135|10|0|but you will not be harmed in the least thereby! So do not be afraid of the three lions, for these fully know you to be their lord.'
CJ|0|135|11|0|Cyrenius thanked the Baby most fervently in his heart as also did his wife Tullia, but she knew nothing of what the Baby had just discussed with Cyrenius.
CJ|0|135|12|0|When it was quite late in the evening, Cyrenius took his leave with his entire company, repeated once more his invitation for the following day and having been blest went his way into the city.
CJ|0|135|13|0|When he entered his sleeping-chamber, the three lions were already at hand and stoutly accompanied Cyrenius into the great chamber.
CJ|0|135|14|0|And when he went to his couch with Tullia, the lions took their places around it, steadily keeping their eyes on the entrance door.
CJ|0|135|15|0|The servants of Cyrenius went in and out a number of times, but the lions paid no attention to them.
CJ|0|135|16|0|During the second watch in the night, twenty muffled men treading very stealthily came into the sleeping-hall of Cyrenius and very quietly approached his couch.
CJ|0|135|17|0|But when they were hardly five more steps away from the couch and pulled out their daggers,
CJ|0|135|18|0|the three lions amid the most fearful roars suddenly pounced on them and tore them to pieces in a few moments, and not one escaped this attack.
CJ|0|135|19|0|For none was prepared for such an attack - at the first pounce all fell into the greatest fear and confusion and did not even think of defending themselves.
CJ|0|135|20|0|For that reason not one found his way out and consequently fell prey to the fury of the lions.
CJ|0|135|21|0|Thus Cyrenius was marvelously saved during this night by the three lions and was not a little amazed the next morning when he beheld the dismembered corpses in the great sleeping-hall.
CJ|0|136|1|1|The Discovery Of The Traitor
CJ|0|136|1|0|CYRENIUS QUICKLY awakened his household servants and summoned them to his sleeping-hall to explain how such treachery took place.
CJ|0|136|2|0|The household servants were alarmed at what they saw there and assured the angry governor,
CJ|0|136|3|0|'Most strict, just and most powerful lord, lord! Let the gods be our witnesses that we did not know anything whatever about this.
CJ|0|136|4|0|We will all suffer death if we took the least part in it or even have the least knowledge of it!'
CJ|0|136|5|0|Thereupon Cyrenius asserted, 'Then take these corpses outside and bury them in front of this citadel in the open place as a warning example to all who might still be of the same mind!'
CJ|0|136|6|0|But the servants were in great fear of the three lions who still were closely watching the sleeping couch of Cyrenius, and protested,
CJ|0|136|7|0|'Oh lord, lord! See, we do not dare to touch anything here, for the three beasts have too grim an appearance and could do the same with us as they did with these assassins.'
CJ|0|136|8|0|Here Cyrenius said, 'Whoever among you has a clear conscience, let him step forth and see for himself that these fierce animals also respect faithfulness.'
CJ|0|136|9|0|At these words of Cyrenius all except one stepped forth, and the lions did not harm them in the least.
CJ|0|136|10|0|Cyrenius then asked the one who stood back, 'Why do you stand back, since you can see how your comrades are not harmed by the lions in the least?'
CJ|0|136|11|0|And the one questioned replied, 'Lord, lord, be merciful to me, for my conscience is not clear!'
CJ|0|136|12|0|Cyrenius asked him, 'Wherein then is your conscience not clear? Speak, if you do not wish to die!'
CJ|0|136|13|0|And the questioned servant said, 'Lord, lord, I knew of this treachery since yesterday morning, but did not want to tell you anything about it because I was bought off with a hundred pounds of silver!
CJ|0|136|14|0|For I thought to myself that you would.'be saved anyway, like the wise man outside was saved in the villa, sol accepted the silver.'
CJ|0|136|15|0|At this Cyrenius sprang up and exclaimed, 'It seems as if every sincere humanitarian must also have a devil among his servants and friends!
CJ|0|136|16|0|You miserable scoundrel, step over here before the tribunal of God! If you find grace before this tribunal then I will not judge you either,
CJ|0|136|17|0|but if you find no grace before this tribunal, then you are already judged forever!'
CJ|0|136|18|0|At this the servant thus questioned and ordered began to quake and collapsed in a dead faint.
CJ|0|136|19|0|Hereat a lion stood up, went over to the unconscious servant, took hold of his hand and very carefully dragged him over in front of Cyrenius, where the guilty one remained lying motionless.
CJ|0|136|20|0|Then the same lion in great haste sprang into the lesser hall wherein he seized upon a bundle, pulled it forth and tore it to pieces,
CJ|0|136|21|0|whereupon the hundred pounds of silver which the servant had received for his silence came into view.
CJ|0|136|22|0|Cyrenius was not a little amazed at this occurrence.
CJ|0|136|23|0|Then the lion again took hold of the guilty one by the arm, pulled him into the lesser hall and laid him down on the exact spot where the bundle had formerly lain.
CJ|0|136|24|0|There he dealt him several blows with his tail, which brought the stunned servant back to consciousness and did not harm him otherwise.
CJ|0|136|25|0|The lion then returned to its former place and maintained a passive attitude along with its two comrades.
CJ|0|136|26|0|The servants now began to remove the corpses as ordered by Cyrenius. And Cyrenius honored and praised the God of Israel for having so wonderfully saved him, and in one hour the sleeping-chamber was completely cleansed again.
CJ|0|137|1|1|The Family Arrives At The Citadel Of Cyrenius
CJ|0|137|1|0|TULLIA did not awaken from a refreshing sleep until no sign remained in the sleeping-chamber of what had happened during the night.
CJ|0|137|2|0|Cyrenius thereupon asked her if she had slept quite peacefully,
CJ|0|137|3|0|of which Tullia assured him, since she had been very tired from the trip up the mountain.
CJ|0|137|4|0|Here Cyrenius said, 'That was very lucky for you!
CJ|0|137|5|0|For if you had been awake last night, you would have endured a great fright!
CJ|0|137|6|0|See, only one hour ago this chamber was a scene of horror!'
CJ|0|137|7|0|And Tullia, quite surprised, asked Cyrenius just what had taken place.
CJ|0|137|8|0|Cyrenius now showed Tullia the three lions and asserted in a strongly raised voice,
CJ|0|137|9|0|'Tullia, see, these are surely three terrible animals! They are kings in animal strength, fury and ferocity once they are provoked,
CJ|0|137|10|0|and woe to every wanderer in the wilderness where they have their haunts!
CJ|0|137|11|0|Nothing can save him from their fury! One pounce, and a human lies torn to pieces in the red-hot dust of the desert!
CJ|0|137|12|0|But for all that there are human beings compared to whom these animals are angels from heaven.
CJ|0|137|13|0|These rending animals last night kept us both from the fury of human beings and have torn twenty assassins to pieces in this hall!'
CJ|0|137|14|0|Tullia was terrified at this tale of her husband and inquired,
CJ|0|137|15|0|'How did that happen? Why did I not know anything about it? If you knew something beforehand, why did you not tell me about it?'
CJ|0|137|16|0|Cyrenius replied, 'Tullia, I knew indeed that something would happen last night-
CJ|0|137|17|0|but in just what way, strictly speaking, I did not know, for I knew only as much as the divine Child of my friend told me.
CJ|0|137|18|0|And that I did not tell you anything about it came from my great love to you, little wife of my heart!
CJ|0|137|19|0|See, everything is now behind us; the God of Israel has preserved us marvelously from an ignominious end,
CJ|0|137|20|0|for which we will also love, honor and praise Him in the depth of our hearts our whole life long!
CJ|0|137|21|0|And now, since you are already dressed, let us go forth to meet the exalted family on their way here and receive them still outside the city gate.'
CJ|0|137|22|0|Cyrenius now directed his servants to prepare everything for the approaching celebration and to put everything in the best order
CJ|0|137|23|0|and ordered the traitorous servant to follow him outside the city gate.
CJ|0|137|24|0|At that moment Maronius with the three priests emerged from another part of the citadel and announced to Cyrenius that the exalted family was already approaching the citadel.
CJ|0|137|25|0|At this Cyrenius dropped everything and with pounding heart hurried to meet his friend Joseph, but Joseph already came toward him with outstretched arms on the first flight of steps with Mary, the Baby and his whole heavenly company.
CJ|0|138|1|1|Love and Compassion Are Better Than Justice
CJ|0|138|1|0|CYRENIUS embraced Joseph with the greatest affection and told him in a few words what had happened in the citadel during the night.
CJ|0|138|2|0|Joseph acknowledged: 'My very dear friend and brother in the Lord, what you want to tell me I already knew before it happened, and that in complete detail just as it afterward took place!
CJ|0|138|3|0|But one thing you should not have done after that as you did.
CJ|0|138|4|0|And this one thing is that you had the torn corpses buried in the public place.
CJ|0|138|5|0|Of course you did this from a politically correct point of view in order to keep others from similar attempts by such an example,
CJ|0|138|6|0|but that is a very short-lived expedient! See, nothing in the world has a shorter life than horror, fear and sadness!
CJ|0|138|7|0|Hence an expedient which awakens these three emotions is no more justified than the by it awakened emotions themselves.
CJ|0|138|8|0|When any man has shaken off these three emblems of judgment by means of his free spirit, he then becomes angry and thereupon attacks the cruel judge with redoubled fury.
CJ|0|138|9|0|Do you therefore always lead the people with the love that lasts forever, and seek to hide such expedient, but for all that horrifying examples from the people, and you will constantly enjoy the people's love.
CJ|0|138|10|0|'I tell you: A drop of compassion at every opportunity is better than a whole palace full of the best intentioned but very strict justice!
CJ|0|138|11|0|For compassion betters the enemy as well as the friend, while the best intentioned but very strict justice makes the just one proud and overbearing,
CJ|0|138|12|0|and the one guilty and so judged is filled with wrath and thinks only of how he may revenge himself against the one that is just.
CJ|0|138|13|0|What you have now done cannot be made undone any more,
CJ|0|138|14|0|but in the future remember this rule. It is better than gold, yes, better than purest gold.'
CJ|0|138|15|0|Here Cyrenius again fell about Joseph's neck and thanked him for this teaching like a son his father.
CJ|0|138|16|0|Thereupon the entire company went into the bed-chamber of Cyrenius which, as was always the custom with prominent Romans, consisted of a large hall.
CJ|0|138|17|0|For the Romans said: During sleep man exhales his sickness,
CJ|0|138|18|0|and if it does not have the proper space to scatter itself in the bed-chamber, it falls back on him again and he becomes sick. -
CJ|0|138|19|0|For this reason wealthy Romans had fountains in their large sleeping-halls, which purified the air and absorbed the bad vapors.
CJ|0|138|20|0|Thus the sleeping-hall of Cyrenius was also the greatest hall in the castle and was provided with two fountains with wide water basins in which floated several sea-onions.
CJ|0|138|21|0|The entire hall was of great, old-Egyptian splendor, and the floor consisted of black and brown marble.
CJ|0|138|22|0|The whole company was now present in this hall and discussed various matters of former times, while all the servants of Cyrenius were hurriedly putting the side-halls in the best possible order.
CJ|0|139|1|1|An Example Of Compassion
CJ|0|139|1|0|THE TREACHEROUS SERVANT stood in a corner of the hall and in his heart regretted the step which he had undertaken against his master -
CJ|0|139|2|0|but no one thought of him, for all were engaged in profound discussions.
CJ|0|139|3|0|Besides, the faithful servants of Cyrenius were busily occupied right and left arranging for the banquet, in the kitchen and with the setting up of all manner of ornaments.
CJ|0|139|4|0|Thus the servants did not think of their beyond all measure sad comrade.
CJ|0|139|5|0|Here the three lions suddenly arose and trotted over to the rueful servant of Cyrenius, licked him and showed him their sympathy by various gestures.
CJ|0|139|6|0|Maronius was the first to notice what the three lions were doing with the servant and made this known to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|139|7|0|for Maronius feared that the three beasts might perhaps get an appetite for the servant.
CJ|0|139|8|0|When Cyrenius noticed this strange situation of his treacherous servant he began, for the first time, to discuss the offence of this servant with Joseph.
CJ|0|139|9|0|And Joseph assured him: 'Friend and brother, here is an example of what I advised you to do only a short while ago and explained to you how a drop of compassion is better than a whole palace filled with the best intentioned justice!
CJ|0|139|10|0|The three animals here are giving you a good example - go over and as a human being do something better!
CJ|0|139|11|0|On the way over from the villa I heard from one of the servants of the Lord how you praised these three animals to your wife this morning.
CJ|0|139|12|0|How then is it that these three animals are even now showing you what you should have done in the first place?
CJ|0|139|13|0|'See, thus does the Lord constantly instruct the children of men.
CJ|0|139|14|0|Nothing in the world happens in vain - even from the turning of a mote in the sun can one learn true wisdom.
CJ|0|139|15|0|For it is guided by the same wisdom and omnipotence of God and is supported like the sun and the moon of heaven.
CJ|0|139|16|0|All the more then can you look on this occurrence as a very strong hint of the Lord, which clearly tells you what you should do.
CJ|0|139|17|0|Go over and lift up the three-fold poor and deeply fallen one; go and lift up an extremely sad and repentant brother.
CJ|0|139|18|0|For the Lord has now prepared him for you that he may be a most faithful brother to you.'
CJ|0|139|19|0|When Cyrenius heard this from Joseph, he hurried over and grasped the servant under the arms and said,
CJ|0|139|20|0|'Brother, you have acted ill against me, but since I found remorse in you, I raise you up again!
CJ|0|139|21|0|And from now on you shall no more walk at my side as a servant, but as a faithful brother.'
CJ|0|139|22|0|This broke the servant's heart, and he began to weep aloud and to lament that he could have sinned against such nobility of a man among men.
CJ|0|140|1|1|A Gospel Of Forgiveness
CJ|0|140|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS saw the deep gratitude of this servant and his great repentance, he consoled him and said:
CJ|0|140|2|0|'See, my new brother in the Lord, we human beings are all deficient before God, and God forgives us our errors if we recognize and repent them,
CJ|0|140|3|0|when, after all, God is holy, while we are all great sinners before Him!
CJ|0|140|4|0|For if the Holy one forgives, why should we sinners not forgive each other our trespasses?
CJ|0|140|5|0|As long as a person has not sunk to the level of the furies, just that long does God's grace remain with him,
CJ|0|140|6|0|but if a human being becomes a complete devil in the world, then God takes His grace away from him and gives him over to the judgment of hell!
CJ|0|140|7|0|That is why the twenty who bribed you were torn to pieces by the three lions - for they had already become devils.
CJ|0|140|8|0|But you were spared, since you were only misled and were blind and did not know what you had done.
CJ|0|140|9|0|The Lord God has not taken His grace from you and has opened your eyes, so that you came to a full realization of the sin committed by you.
CJ|0|140|10|0|You have repented of the sin that you recognized as such, and God has forgiven your sin.
CJ|0|140|11|0|For that reason do I also forgive you your trespass against me and hereby make you my friend and my brother in the Lord.
CJ|0|140|12|0|Therefore I raise you up and lead you over to my divine, exalted company.
CJ|0|140|13|0|Be of good cheer now and follow me, so you will be blest by my eminent friend to be a real brother!'
CJ|0|140|14|0|This altogether splendid talk of Cyrenius to the treasonable servant had excellent results.
CJ|0|140|15|0|The servant was comforted and strengthened thereby, then arose, and dissolving in tears followed Cyrenius over to the company.
CJ|0|140|16|0|When he arrived there, Joseph promptly lifted up his hands, blessed the servant and said only, 'The Lord be with you!'
CJ|0|140|17|0|Thereupon Cyrenius ordered that shining, splendid clothes be immediately brought and put on the servant
CJ|0|140|18|0|and promptly invested him with a name of honor and then gave him a brother's kiss.
CJ|0|140|19|0|Then Cyrenius called all the servants of the household together and introduced their new brother to them and ordered them to obey him.
CJ|0|140|20|0|Here the servants objected, 'How can you be a just judge since you elevate the traitor, but humiliate us who have always demonstrated the greatest faithfulness to you?'
CJ|0|140|21|0|'What is it to you,' countered Cyrenius, 'if I am kind and compassionate? Which of you has ever lacked anything with me? But none of you has ever risked his life for me!
CJ|0|140|22|0|And he was always the least among you and has risked his life for me - by his action I have become rid of my enemies. Does he therefore not deserve this rank?'
CJ|0|140|23|0|At this the house servants became silent, went about their business again and were satisfied with this answer.
CJ|0|140|24|0|And a youth from the heavens said: 'In the future it will also be just like this in the kingdom of God. There will be more joy over a repentant sinner than over ninety-nine of the just who have never sinned!'
CJ|0|141|1|1|A New Ark Of The Covenant
CJ|0|141|1|0|BY THIS TIME the morning meal was ready and the tables were nicely set,
CJ|0|141|2|0|and the servants came and made this known to Cyrenius.
CJ|0|141|3|0|Cyrenius now inspected everything, found it to be in the best order and invited the company to the table in the great side-hall.
CJ|0|141|4|0|When Joseph went inside he was greatly astonished, for it seemed to him that here in this hall he was in a miniature temple of Solomon in Jerusalem.
CJ|0|141|5|0|Now this arrangement was the work of Maronius Pilla who as former prefect of Jerusalem naturally knew quite well how the temple looked inside and out.
CJ|0|141|6|0|Joseph was filled with joy and said, 'Truly, my brother Cyrenius Quirinus, you could not have put a better thought into effect.
CJ|0|141|7|0|I am now at the Feast of Preparation as in Jerusalem. Only the Holy of Holies is missing - if This were here also, the temple would be complete.
CJ|0|141|8|0|The curtain is indeed here, but behind it the Ark of the Covenant is missing!'
CJ|0|141|9|0|Cyrenius responded, 'Brother, I thought that you would bring along the Holy of Holies alive anyhow - why then should It be here artificially?'
CJ|0|141|10|0|Only now did Joseph recover from his unexpected illusion and thought of the Baby and of Mary.
CJ|0|141|11|0|
CJ|0|141|12|0|'Cyrenius, you have done much to provide a pleasure for the most righteous man on the earth, but one thing you almost forgot!
CJ|0|141|13|0|See, today you are giving a great and glorious feast.
CJ|0|141|14|0|Whatever three continents bring forth that is best and precious is assembled here today.
CJ|0|141|15|0|And therein you do well - for truly, throughout all eternity and infinity no greater honor has befallen a house in any world than now befalls yours!
CJ|0|141|16|0|For you now have Him before you before whom all the powers of heaven cover up their faces.
CJ|0|141|17|0|Joseph has indicated to you that the Holy of Holies in this temple is empty.
CJ|0|141|18|0|So it is - but so it shall not be.
CJ|0|141|19|0|Send out your servants and they shall bring here all manner of poor, blind, lame, crippled and afflicted people.
CJ|0|141|20|0|Have a table set up for these in the imitated Holy of Holies and have them festively served, and My servants will wait on them.
CJ|0|141|21|0|And behold, then the Holy of Holies will be alive and will represent the Most Holy One better than the now empty Ark of the Covenant in Jerusalem.
CJ|0|141|22|0|At the same time provide three billy goats and throw them to the lions so they will also be fed.'
CJ|0|141|23|0|Cyrenius thereupon kissed the Baby and at once followed His advice.
CJ|0|141|24|0|And in one hour the prototype of the Holy of Holies was filled with the poor, and the lions received their fare.
CJ|0|142|1|1|Joseph's Place Of Honor In The World
CJ|0|142|1|0|ONLY AFTER everything had thus been put in order did Joseph raise his eyes to heaven and thank the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
CJ|0|142|2|0|And only when he had completed his prayer of thanks did he, along with his own, take a place at the very foot of the royally bedecked table of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|142|3|0|Cyrenius immediately hurried over to Joseph and protested,
CJ|0|142|4|0|'No, no, my truly exalted friend and brother, that will not do - for this feast concerns you and not me.
CJ|0|142|5|0|Therefore your place is there at the head of the table, and not here at the foot.
CJ|0|142|6|0|So arise, and let me seat you and yours there at the head of the table where it is laid with gold.
CJ|0|142|7|0|Here at the foot my company shall sit and recline; for thus I have ordered it myself.'
CJ|0|142|8|0|Joseph answered, 'Cyrenius, because I am your very sincere friend and brother I remain seated with my own here at the foot.
CJ|0|142|9|0|See, with me you lose nothing although I sit here at the least honored place,
CJ|0|142|10|0|but with your great companions in offices of the state you lose much if you do not set them at the head.
CJ|0|142|11|0|So leave things as they are. In the world the world shall have its privilege, but in the kingdom of God matters will be quite the opposite - for there the last shall be the first at the table of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.'
CJ|0|142|12|0|Here Cyrenius objected, 'Oh brother, I have looked forward to this day that I might bring you, the son of a king, also a kingly honor -
CJ|0|142|13|0|and now half of my joy is gone since I must see even you, for whom all this is intended, at the very least place.
CJ|0|142|14|0|Brother, go and at least sit in the middle place so I will be closer to you at the table.'
CJ|0|142|15|0|And Joseph replied, 'But my very dear brother, you surely are not going to be childish?
CJ|0|142|16|0|You know that I must always and everywhere remain in that order which the Lord God lays down for me in my heart.
CJ|0|142|17|0|How then can you want to tempt me over and above this order?
CJ|0|142|18|0|You set your great and glittering ones at the head, and you as lord can sit down wherever you please since every place at the table is fitting for you.
CJ|0|142|19|0|Herewith this matter is settled - by the golden tableware your great ones will recognize the leading place at the table and will feel highly honored if you vacate such places of honor wholly to them and choose a lesser one for yourself.'
CJ|0|142|20|0|Cyrenius understood Joseph's words, thereupon assigned the foremost places to his eminent ones
CJ|0|142|21|0|and he himself with Tullia sat down at the middle of the table.
CJ|0|142|22|0|And thus everything was in good order - the eminent ones were filled with joy that they sat at the head,
CJ|0|142|23|0|Cyrenius was gay in the middle, and Joseph with his own was in the best of spirits that even at this great and splendid festival he could remain in God's good order.
CJ|0|143|1|1|A Captain Seeks Enlightenment
CJ|0|143|1|0|THE MORNING MEAL lasted for an hour, and during that time much was said about many things.
CJ|0|143|2|0|A captain seated at the end of the table, who had also been present on the mountain trip, now asked one of the three former priests,
CJ|0|143|3|0|'Listen to me! See, we have a doctrine about the gods, according to which everything teems with gods wherever we happen to look;
CJ|0|143|4|0|but I have never seen nor noticed a trace of a god anywhere!
CJ|0|143|5|0|I have not infrequently dreamed about a thousand things - but never about any sort of deity.
CJ|0|143|6|0|Now who among all of us now living human beings can testify and confess in conscientious truth: I have seen and spoken with Zeus or any other deity?
CJ|0|143|7|0|And since we all are only human beings just like those who in ancient days are supposed to have associated with the gods,
CJ|0|143|8|0|I just cannot see why the gods now desert us and do not in the least concern themselves with us any more.
CJ|0|143|9|0|Could you, as a former priest, not give me some valid reason for that?'
CJ|0|143|10|0|The lesser priest answered, 'Dear friend, I beg you, whatever you do, never ask me about such most ridiculous things.
CJ|0|143|11|0|Our gods are nothing but pure ephemera which originate in the morass of our stupidity.
CJ|0|143|12|0|And since we in our stupidity are able to discern nothing better than the products of our own morass, we therefore prefer these and picture them in our minds as gods,
CJ|0|143|13|0|build temples to them and in these worship the altogether null and void products of our stupidity.
CJ|0|143|14|0|See, those are the gods to whom we have built temples, and with which Rome abounds.
CJ|0|143|15|0|Yes, there is indeed a true God, but He has always been holy, and we in our hearts most unclean beings cannot see Him, but nevertheless His works.
CJ|0|143|16|0|Now if you wish to find out a few things about this one God, then turn to yonder chaste Jew. He will surely - I swear it to you - teach you to know Him more closely.'
CJ|0|143|17|0|With this information the captain was satisfied, for he there received just the answer which he had long been seeking.
CJ|0|143|18|0|He then made his way over to Joseph and made his wish known to him.
CJ|0|143|19|0|But Joseph retorted, 'Good man, everything requires its time. When you are ready it will be revealed to you, so be content with this promise for the present.'
CJ|0|144|1|1|The Baby Reproves Joseph
CJ|0|144|1|0|WHEN THE CAPTAIN has thus been dismissed, Joseph said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|144|2|0|'Brother, now let us have a look at the Holy of Holies.'
CJ|0|144|3|0|Cyrenius most happily acceded to the request of his to him invaluable friend.
CJ|0|144|4|0|Here the Baby sat erect and said to Joseph:
CJ|0|144|5|0|'Hear Me, faithful provider of My body! Just a little while ago you yourself told the captain who is seeking God:
CJ|0|144|6|0|Everything requires its time. When you are ready it will be revealed to you, so be content with this promise for now.
CJ|0|144|7|0|Thus I also say to you before entering the here imitated as well as to-be-imitated Holy of Holies:
CJ|0|144|8|0|This entry also requires its time! All of you are still not ready for it, and when you are ready I will have it opened for you by My servants.
CJ|0|144|9|0|So you may also be content with this promise for the present.'
CJ|0|144|10|0|At this Joseph and Cyrenius gazed at each other wide-eyed, and the embarrassment of one topped that of the other.
CJ|0|144|11|0|Joseph then said to Mary, 'That promises well, so the Baby now gives me laws while He still has His feet in diapers!
CJ|0|144|12|0|What then will He do when He numbers ten years, and what, when twenty?'
CJ|0|144|13|0|And Mary answered Joseph, 'But dear father Joseph, how can you waver in your faith also?
CJ|0|144|14|0|The angels plainly show you with their beyond all measure great humility who this Baby is!
CJ|0|144|15|0|And the many wonders which take place about us surely are also a loud and clear-as-sunlight proof of this great and marvelous truth of truths.
CJ|0|144|16|0|See, I, your faithful wife and your handmaiden, can plainly see to what the words of the Baby refer.
CJ|0|144|17|0|You do that, and I believe I can guarantee in advance that another wind will promptly blow.'
CJ|0|144|18|0|Hereupon Joseph again asked Mary, 'Well, just what is it that I shall do now?'
CJ|0|144|19|0|Mary answered, 'Look at the man who there seeks and wisely show him What he seeks, from which he believes himself to be so far and is so near.'
CJ|0|144|20|0|And the Baby smiled at Joseph in a most friendly manner and said,
CJ|0|144|21|0|'Yes, yes, My very dear Joseph, the woman is right - go over and instruct the captain.
CJ|0|144|22|0|See, to those who ask, seek and knock, the long-locked door into My kingdom must be opened!
CJ|0|144|23|0|But you must not point straight at Me with your finger since My time has not yet come. As you well know, everything requires its time.'
CJ|0|144|24|0|Joseph thereupon kissed the Baby, then went over to the captain and assured him,
CJ|0|144|25|0|'Come and hear - What you seek shall be given you!' - And the captain listened joyfully to the words of Joseph.
CJ|0|145|1|1|Joseph Tells The Captain Of The Messiah
CJ|0|145|1|0|WHEN THE CAPTAIN had heard the main tenets of the doctrine of God and therewith also a few indications of the Messiah,
CJ|0|145|2|0|he became very pensive and asked after a while when this Messiah should come.
CJ|0|145|3|0|Joseph answered 'This Messiah, through whom all men will be freed from the yoke of death and who will bring the fallen-away earth into contact with the heavens again, is already here!'
CJ|0|145|4|0|The captain inquired, 'If this Messiah is already here, so tell me where He is, and how one may recognize Him.'
CJ|0|145|5|0|And Joseph responded: it is not permitted me that I should point Him out to you with my finger.
CJ|0|145|6|0|But as concerns the signs, I will tell you a few things about that.
CJ|0|145|7|0|See, to begin with the Messiah will be the living, eternal Son of the Most High, to you up to now unknown God.
CJ|0|145|8|0|An altogether spotless virgin will conceive Him in a most marvelous way by the sole power of the Most High.
CJ|0|145|9|0|And when He has been conceived and born, all fullness of the most exalted power of God will dwell in His flesh.
CJ|0|145|10|0|And when He dwells on the earth bodily, His servants and messengers will step down from the high heavens to the earth and will serve Him in secret and also openly in front of many people.
CJ|0|145|11|0|He will by words and deeds bless all who follow Him with deeds according to His words and who become inflamed for Him in their hearts.
CJ|0|145|12|0|But those who do not wish to acknowledge Him will be judged by His almighty Word which He will indelibly engrave into the heart of every human being.
CJ|0|145|13|0|'His words will not be like those of a man, but will be full of power and full of life - and whosoever hears these words and keeps them in his heart to be transformed into action according to them will eternally never taste death!
CJ|0|145|14|0|'And in His manner He will be as gentle as a lamb and as tender as a turtle-dove,
CJ|0|145|15|0|but all the elements will nevertheless obey His subtlest breath!
CJ|0|145|16|0|When He commands the winds ever so quietly - they will break loose and furrow up the sea down to the bottom!
CJ|0|145|17|0|When He glances across the turbulent sea - the waters will turn into a calm mirror!
CJ|0|145|18|0|If He breathes on the earth - it will open up its old graves and will have to deliver all the dead to life again!
CJ|0|145|19|0|And the fire will become a cooling balm to him who carries the Messiah's Word alive in his breast! -
CJ|0|145|20|0|Now, dear captain, here you have the fundamental characteristics of the Messiah, by which you may easily recognize Him.
CJ|0|145|21|0|More I am not permitted to say about Him. His whereabouts you will surely discover very easily and very soon.'
CJ|0|145|22|0|This explanation made a very powerful impression on the captain, so that he hardly trusted himself to say any more.
CJ|0|145|23|0|He thereupon went to the lesser priest to whom he had already spoken and asked him,
CJ|0|145|24|0|'Did you happen to overhear what this eminently wise Jew has discussed with me?'
CJ|0|145|25|0|The lesser priest replied, I tell you: Every little word penetrated deep into my marveling soul!'
CJ|0|145|26|0|The captain continued, 'Then tell me, what sort of an end will our gods come to afterwards, so the to me most remarkably pictured Messiah of the world will assert Himself in the full activity of His altogether divine power.'
CJ|0|145|27|0|The lesser priest answered: 'Did you not feel the power of the mighty gale three days ago?
CJ|0|145|28|0|On the mountain - did you not witness the sudden end of our former temple of Apollo and all the signs following thereafter?
CJ|0|145|29|0|See, the same will happen to Rome in the near future. The temples will become dusty rubble.
CJ|0|145|30|0|And where sacrifices are still brought to Zeus there you will soon see a broken heap of stones - but in place of that men will build living temples in their hearts.
CJ|0|145|31|0|In these every man, just like a priest, will be able to bring a living sacrifice to the only true God, everywhere and at any time. I can tell you that much and no more. Do you want more? See, there are those who know more than I. So do not ask me any more.'
CJ|0|146|1|1|Joseph Defines True Love Of God
CJ|0|146|1|0|THE CAPTAIN now asked the lesser priest no more but went right over to Joseph again,
CJ|0|146|2|0|promptly told him all he had heard from the lesser priest
CJ|0|146|3|0|and asked Joseph how seriously he should take all that.
CJ|0|146|4|0|Joseph answered: 'For the time being place only as much value on what has been told you as the words in themselves are worth,
CJ|0|146|5|0|but await everything else in patience as the future brings it and you will fare best.
CJ|0|146|6|0|See, the holy kingdom of the Messiah does not consist in asking and answering,
CJ|0|146|7|0|but solely in patience, love, gentleness of manner and in complete submission to the divine will.
CJ|0|146|8|0|For with God nothing can be unduly hurried, nothing forced and least of all can anything be obtained from Him by obstinacy.
CJ|0|146|9|0|When the Lord considers it to be good for you, He will also lead you into the higher revelation.
CJ|0|146|10|0|So conceive an immediate, living love to the God I have just revealed to you in all clarity - in this manner you will arrive where you really seek to be in the shortest possible time.
CJ|0|146|11|0|Yes, such love will at once give you more life than you might gain with a million dead questions.'
CJ|0|146|12|0|The captain agreed, 'Good, my highly honored, truly wise friend! I will do all that - but you must tell me this: How does one love your God, about whom one still knows too little?'
CJ|0|146|13|0|And Joseph replied: 'As you love your brother and your eventual bride, so also love God!
CJ|0|146|14|0|Love your fellow men as nothing but brothers and sisters in God, and in that way you will also love God.
CJ|0|146|15|0|Do good at every opportunity, and you will have God's grace.
CJ|0|146|16|0|Be compassionate toward everyone, and you will also find the true, living compassion with God.
CJ|0|146|17|0|Furthermore, keep your temper in all things, be gentle and full of patience, and flee vanity, pride and jealousy like the plague -
CJ|0|146|18|0|'then will the Lord awaken a mighty flame in your heart
CJ|0|146|19|0|and the powerful light of this spiritual flame will banish all the black shades of death from within you, and you will find all your questions answered in a most splendid and quickening manner!
CJ|0|146|20|0|See, that is the right way to the light and life coming from God. That is the right kind of love toward God - this road tread.'
CJ|0|146|21|0|When the captain received this forceful doctrine from Joseph, he desisted from his many still remaining questions and became deeply absorbed in thought.
CJ|0|146|22|0|At the same time the curtain was drawn widely apart by the youths, and Joseph saw that the time had come to go into this imitation of the Holy of Holies.
CJ|0|146|23|0|And while they were still at the entrance to this great hall, a mighty shout of thanks rose toward them from the poor guests.
CJ|0|146|24|0|But when the splendidly dressed Cyrenius with Joseph and Mary with the Baby stepped into the imitated Holy of Holies for the first time, the poor ones were beside themselves.
CJ|0|146|25|0|This sight cost Cyrenius many tears of joy and sympathy, as it did Joseph and Mary.
CJ|0|146|26|0|There were many blind, lame and cripples of all kinds among them, for they numbered into the hundreds.
CJ|0|146|27|0|Here Mary prayed secretly, then took the cloth with which she often daubed the Baby and daubed the eyes of all the blind therewith - and all regained their sight. After this deed the praising and extolling just would not end, so the company returned to the main hall for a short time.
CJ|0|147|1|1|The Healing Of The Afflicted Guests
CJ|0|147|1|0|AFTER A WHILE the exalted company returned to the imitated Holy of Holies and was again received with the greatest praise.
CJ|0|147|2|0|And the lame, the crippled and those otherwise afflicted cried, 'Oh you glorious mother who did help the blind, we beg you, free us also from our great anguish!'
CJ|0|147|3|0|Mary replied: 'Why do you call to me? I can give you no aid - for I, like you, am only a weak mortal handmaiden of my Lord.
CJ|0|147|4|0|Now the One I carry upon my arms can indeed help you, for in Him dwells the eternal fullness of the divine omnipotence!'
CJ|0|147|5|0|But the sick did not listen to Mary's talk and cried all the more, 'Oh glorious mother, help us, help us wretches and make us free from our suffering!'
CJ|0|147|6|0|Here the Baby sat up and stretched forth His hand over the sick - and they all were completely healed in an instant.
CJ|0|147|7|0|The lame sprang like harts, the crippled became straight as the cedars of Lebanon, and all the other afflicted were freed from their ailments.
CJ|0|147|8|0|And the angels then went over to all of these poor, told them to remain silent and informed them of the nearness of the kingdom of God on earth.
CJ|0|147|9|0|This occurrence brought the captain out of his deep meditation, and he also went into the Holy of Holies after the others.
CJ|0|147|10|0|Arrived there, he went directly over to Joseph and asked him, 'Most worthy friend, what happened here? I just do not see any more blind, nor lame, nor crippled or other afflicted!
CJ|0|147|11|0|What? Have they all been healed by a miracle, or was their former wretched condition only a sham?'
CJ|0|147|12|0|And Joseph responded, 'Go over and discuss that yourself with those who now are such a riddle to you. They will best be able to tell you what has now taken place with them.'
CJ|0|147|13|0|The captain promptly did what Joseph had advised him to do, for the asking of questions was after all this captain's weak side.
CJ|0|147|14|0|But everywhere he received one and the same answer, for each one replied, i became well in a miraculous manner!'
CJ|0|147|15|0|Here the captain returned to Joseph and asked him,
CJ|0|147|16|0|'Which one of you actually caused the miracle? Who among you possesses such marvelous power? Which one of you is therefore surely of God?'
CJ|0|147|17|0|Joseph now said, 'See, there the poor ones who were healed still stand.
CJ|0|147|18|0|Go over to them again and ask them - they will surely give you the right indication.'
CJ|0|147|19|0|The captain promptly went over to the poor again and inquired after the miracle worker.
CJ|0|147|20|0|But the poor said, 'Look at the great company - from its middle the healing came to us marvelously!
CJ|0|147|21|0|The little Jewess seems to bear the power. But how? The gods will know that better than we.'
CJ|0|147|22|0|Now the captain did not know much more than before.
CJ|0|147|23|0|Joseph then advised the captain, 'See, you are a wealthy man of Rome - provide for these poor ones now out of love to God, and you will find out more! And be content with that for now!'
CJ|0|148|1|1|The Unveiling Of The Spiritual Life
CJ|0|148|1|0|WHEN THE CAPTAIN heard this from Joseph he did not deliberate for long, but went over to Cyrenius and said,
CJ|0|148|2|0|'Imperial, consular highness! His eminence has surely heard what the wise Jew has advised this unworthy person to do.
CJ|0|148|3|0|For that reason I have promptly decided to follow his advice without delay.
CJ|0|148|4|0|Therefore I beg his eminence to sanction me this decision according to which I would like to take all of these poor into my care as if they were my own children.'
CJ|0|148|5|0|Cyrenius retorted, 'My very esteemed, dear captain! I am sorry that I cannot let this noble pleasure come your way.
CJ|0|148|6|0|You see, I have just taken them all into my own care.
CJ|0|148|7|0|But you must not be sad on that account, for you will still meet enough poor.
CJ|0|148|8|0|Carry out the advice of the wise Jew with them and you will harvest an equal reward.'
CJ|0|148|9|0|At this the captain bowed before Cyrenius, then went directly over to Joseph and asked,
CJ|0|148|10|0|'Now what can I do, when Cyrenius has already anticipated me? Where will I get the poor now? For here they are gathered from all of Ostracine.'
CJ|0|148|11|0|And Joseph smiled at the captain in a friendly manner and assured him,
CJ|0|148|12|0|'Oh my very kind friend, do not ever be concerned about that, for the earth has always had a greater lack of everything else than of the poor.
CJ|0|148|13|0|See, they do not have to be exactly blind, lame, crippled and afflicted with other ailments.
CJ|0|148|14|0|Go and inspect the families in the houses; convince yourself of their manifold need and you will immediately find plenty of opportunity to generously put your abundance to work.
CJ|0|148|15|0|See, this city as a whole is anyhow more of a ruin than an even to some extent stately, prospering city.
CJ|0|148|16|0|Just search through the half-decayed dwellings of many a citizen, and you will immediately see the foolishness of your concern over the lack of poor people.'
CJ|0|148|17|0|Here the captain admitted, 'Dear, wise friend, therein you are undoubtedly right!
CJ|0|148|18|0|But those poor people will be able to give me little enlightenment about the coming Messiah, since they as well as I are in a false faith compared to you.
CJ|0|148|19|0|Now these people have experienced many wonderful things and could by and by have disclosed many a thing to me.'
CJ|0|148|20|0|And Joseph answered the captain: 'Oho, my dear friend! Do you really think that the unveiling of the spiritual life can be had from the poor?
CJ|0|148|21|0|Oh, therein you are under a great illusion. See, the unveiling depends only on your own heart and spirit. When you practice love, then out of the flame of such love a light will be born to you, but not from the mouth of the poor!' With this explanation the captain was satisfied and henceforth asked no more what he should do.
CJ|0|149|1|1|How the Sabbath Is To Be Kept
CJ|0|149|1|0|WHEN THE CAPTAIN had thus been put at ease, Cyrenius ordered the commander of the garrison to fit out a ship by the following day in which these poor were to be taken to Tyre.
CJ|0|149|2|0|Here the commander informed him, 'Imperial, consular highness! According to my knowledge only one old Carthaginian ship still lies out in the harbor, but it is in a very defective condition.
CJ|0|149|3|0|There are no shipwrights in this city - only a few very miserable carpenters here and there who can barely tie no more than a fishing raft together.
CJ|0|149|4|0|It is therefore to be greatly questioned how we are to make the old Carthaginian ship seaworthy.'
CJ|0|149|5|0|Cyrenius said, 'Do not worry - we shall promptly get the best advice for that.
CJ|0|149|6|0|See, that wise Jew according to his craft is a great master carpenter and likewise his five sons.
CJ|0|149|7|0|Him I will ask, and I am convinced that he will give me the best advice especially in this matter.'
CJ|0|149|8|0|Here Cyrenius immediately turned to Joseph and presented the matter to him.
CJ|0|149|9|0|Joseph answered, 'Friend and brother, everything would be well and proper if only today were not our most important Sabbath on which we may not undertake any labor.
CJ|0|149|10|0|But perhaps there are carpenters here whom our Sabbath does not concern; these I will be glad to advise.'
CJ|0|149|11|0|Here the Baby sat up and said: 'Joseph, every man may do good as far as the Sabbath is concerned.
CJ|0|149|12|0|The keeping of the Sabbath does not consist in idleness the whole day through, but much rather in the doing of good works.
CJ|0|149|13|0|Moses to be sure taught that the keeping of the Sabbath was most necessary and in his Law characterized every unnecessary and menially paid-for labor as a desecration of the Sabbath, which is an abomination before God -
CJ|0|149|14|0|but Moses never forbade the doing of God's will on the Sabbath.
CJ|0|149|15|0|Nowhere in the Law does it state that one should allow a brother to perish on the Sabbath!
CJ|0|149|16|0|'And I, as the Lord of the Sabbath, say this: Always do good also on the Sabbath, and you will celebrate the Sabbath in the best manner!
CJ|0|149|17|0|But if you, Joseph, do not trust yourself to only seemingly transgress the Law of Moses by the easy repair" of that ship, then My servants shall do so right away.'
CJ|0|149|18|0|Joseph replied, 'My divine little Son, You are no doubt right - but You see, I am become old in the Law and do not want to transgress it even seemingly.'
CJ|0|149|19|0|Here the Baby immediately called the youths and stated, 'So then do you go and fulfill! My will,
CJ|0|149|20|0|for Joseph honors the Law more than the Lawgiver and the Sabbath more than the Lord of the Sabbath!'
CJ|0|149|21|0|As quick as though the youths left the great hall, repaired the ship in an instant, and just as quickly returned.
CJ|0|149|22|0|All were astonished at this speed, and many did not believe that the ship had been made seaworthy. But soon messengers came from the harbor who reported this deed to Cyrenius. Thereupon the entire company went down to the shore, inspected the ship and was astonished at such dexterity of the youths.
CJ|0|150|1|1|The Miraculously Repaired Ship
CJ|0|150|1|0|CYRENIUS INSPECTED the ship closely and estimated how many people would probably find room therein.
CJ|0|150|2|0|And he found that if necessary it could comfortably accommodate a thousand people.
CJ|0|150|3|0|While he was making this estimate, Cyrenius also convinced himself of the extraordinary sturdiness and symmetry of this ship -
CJ|0|150|4|0|for it did not appear as if it were an old and patched-up one, but the entire ship seemed as if it had been poured in one mold.
CJ|0|150|5|0|No seam could be discovered, nor were any yearly rings, knots nor other grains or wood pores to be seen.
CJ|0|150|6|0|When Cyrenius had convinced himself of all this, he returned with his aides to the company on the shore. Arrived there, he went directly over to Joseph and asserted,
CJ|0|150|7|0|'My truly exalted friend, you are the most fortunate of men on the earth! I do not wonder about the miracle at all any more, for I know only too well by now that all things are possible with God.
CJ|0|150|8|0|I know that this is no built and repaired ship, but one created wholly anew - but I am not surprised thereat,
CJ|0|150|9|0|for it would undoubtedly be just as easy for the Lord to create a whole world as such a ship. The earth, after all, is also a ship which carries a great many people on the ocean of infinity.
CJ|0|150|10|0|But that you have now put me greatly in your debt, see, that makes me wonder how I shall ever be able to repay you.
CJ|0|150|11|0|'You see, this ship which. recently was worth hardly a pound of silver, since it resembled a wreck more than a ship, is now worth over ten thousand pounds of gold!
CJ|0|150|12|0|For it can now be used for a journey beyond the pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) to Britain, as well as for the circumnavigation of the African continent all the way to India.
CJ|0|150|13|0|Truly, such monumental handiwork cannot, by the standard of its usefulness in the world, be paid for with enough gold!
CJ|0|150|14|0|See, my most eminent friend, that is what now makes me wonder if I really will ever be able to repay you this debt.
CJ|0|150|15|0|If you were to honor the gold, as truly as your and now also my God lives you shall have ten thousand pounds in seven days.
CJ|0|150|16|0|But I know that gold is an abomination in your eyes, and it now saddens me that I must continue to owe something to you, my greatest friend!'
CJ|0|150|17|0|At this Joseph seized Cyrenius by the hand, pressed it to his bosom and tried to speak, and the tears came to his eyes as he beheld this noble Roman.
CJ|0|150|18|0|And in his stead the Baby sat up, smiled at Cyrenius and stated: 'My dear Cyrenius Quirinus, I tell you truly: If you had adopted only one poor soul in My name, you would already have done more than the value of ten thousand such ships could equal!
CJ|0|150|19|0|But you have now provided for several hundred in a short time, and I would have to give you ever so many such ships for it to recompense you on earth for that.
CJ|0|150|20|0|'Behold, with Me one human being is worth more than a whole world full of such ships! So do not be concerned because of your imagined debt.
CJ|0|150|21|0|What you do for the poor, that you also do for Me. And for that I shall not reward you here on earth, but when you die I shall promptly awaken your soul and make you equal with these My servants here who repaired the ship.'
CJ|0|150|22|0|Here Cyrenius wept and avowed that from now on he would devote his whole life to the welfare of the poor and afflicted among mankind.
CJ|0|150|23|0|And the Baby lifted up His hand and said, 'Amen' and thereupon blessed Cyrenius and the ship.
CJ|0|151|1|1|The Seeker Will Find The Right Path
CJ|0|151|1|0|AFTER THIS the company , returned to the city and went to the citadel, where the noonday meal had been prepared wholly according to Jewish custom.
CJ|0|151|2|0|All took their former places again and refreshed themselves at the tastily prepared meal.
CJ|0|151|3|0|Only at the end of the meal did Cyrenius notice that the well-known captain was not present among the guests.
CJ|0|151|4|0|'Where is he, what is he doing?' was the general question at the head of the Roman portion of the table.
CJ|0|151|5|0|Cyrenius now turned to his friend Joseph and asked him about it.
CJ|0|151|6|0|Joseph answered, 'Do not worry about him, for he has gone to seek out the poor in the city.
CJ|0|151|7|0|To be sure, he is still more concerned with the discovery of the inner light than actually with the poor themselves,
CJ|0|151|8|0|but that will not be detrimental to his cause - for to him who seeks the right path will open up of its own accord!'
CJ|0|151|9|0|When Cyrenius learned this, he was very glad indeed and praised the captain in his heart.
CJ|0|151|10|0|While the Roman company was divided over many suppositions about the captain's absence, he came in to the company in good spirits and was promptly assailed with a multitude of questions from all sides.
CJ|0|151|11|0|But the captain, although himself very fond of asking questions, was nonetheless anything but fond of giving answers.
CJ|0|151|12|0|For that reason he promptly went over to Cyrenius and excused himself because he had on this occasion stayed away from the noonday meal.
CJ|0|151|13|0|And Cyrenius gave the captain his hand and assured him,
CJ|0|151|14|0|'Truly, and if we stood before the enemy and you left your place of battle for such a reason, you would have nothing to answer for with me.
CJ|0|151|15|0|For it is true, as I now realize, that we do more if we do good to only one human being, than if we should win all the kingdoms of the world for Rome.
CJ|0|151|16|0|One human being means more to the Lord God than all the rest of the world!
CJ|0|151|17|0|Therefore we do a much greater thing before God if we as brothers provide for a brother's bodily needs out of love - and as much as possible also spiritually -
CJ|0|151|18|0|than if we took the field against many thousands of our worst enemies.
CJ|0|151|19|0|Yes, it is infinitely more praiseworthy before God to be a benefactor to one's brothers, than to be the greatest hero in this mad world!'
CJ|0|151|20|0|And the Baby added thereto: 'Amen! So it is, My Cyrenius Quirinus.
CJ|0|151|21|0|Continue on this road, for truly, as surely as this one no other leads to eternal life! For love is life - whosoever has love, he also has life!' Thereupon the Baby blessed Cyrenius and the captain with His eyes.
CJ|0|152|1|1|Cyrenius As Predecessor Of The Apostle Paul
CJ|0|152|1|0|AFTER THIS DISCUSSION the youths drew back the curtain once more and the whole company again went in to the poor. And the Baby sat erect and blessed the poor with His eyes.
CJ|0|152|2|0|Then He turned to Cyrenius and said to him in a very pleasing tone of voice:
CJ|0|152|3|0|'My beloved Cyrenius Quirinus! See, these My servants whom you see here as frail youths watch over the whole creation in My name!
CJ|0|152|4|0|Every world, every sun must obey their slightest wish,
CJ|0|152|5|0|so you can see that I have granted them unlimited power.
CJ|0|152|6|0|And as I have turned all creation over to these My servants to be governed in an orderly manner, so also do I here turn over to you these much greater worlds of life!
CJ|0|152|7|0|See, these brothers and sisters are more than an infinity filled with suns and worlds!
CJ|0|152|8|0|'Yes, I say to you: A baby in the cradle is more than all the substance in the eternal, infinite space!
CJ|0|152|9|0|Therefore consider what great thing you receive in this gift from Me and over how great a thing I set you!
CJ|0|152|10|0|Lead these poor in all love, gentleness and patience on the right road to Me and you will eternally never be able to measure the greatness of My reward!
CJ|0|152|11|0|'I, your Lord and your God, do hereby make you a forerunner in the realm of the pagans, so that he whom I shall one day send to the pagans shall find an easy reception.
CJ|0|152|12|0|In time to come I shall also send a forerunner to the Jews,
CJ|0|152|13|0|but I tell you: The latter shall have a great deal of trouble! What he will do by the sweat of his brow, you will be able to accomplish in your sleep!
CJ|0|152|14|0|Therefore the light will be taken from the children and entrusted to all of you in all fullness!
CJ|0|152|15|0|'For that reason I as a Child lay the seed in you which will some day give Me the tree that will bear truly choice fruits for My house eternally.
CJ|0|152|16|0|But the fig tree with the children, which I already planted in Abraham's day in Salem - a city which I as Melchisedek built with My own hand - I shall curse, since it bears nothing but leaves!
CJ|0|152|17|0|Truly, it has hungered Me yet always! Many times I had the tree in Salem fertilized by good gardeners, and still it bore Me no fruit!
CJ|0|152|18|0|'Before a century passes, therefore, the city which My hand built for My children shall fall to you strangers, for your brother's son shall take up the sword against Salem!
CJ|0|152|19|0|And just as you now adopt these poor people as your children so also shall I adopt you strangers as My children, and you shall cast out the children! -
CJ|0|152|20|0|Keep these words to yourself and act according to them in secret, and I will always bless you with the invisible crown of My eternal love and grace, Amen!'
CJ|0|152|21|0|These words caused all to fall silent. The angels lay on their faces, and no one trusted himself to speak or to inquire about anything.
CJ|0|153|1|1|The Word Of The Lord To Isaiah
CJ|0|153|1|0|AFTER A WHILE Cyrenius drew Joseph aside and asked him,
CJ|0|153|2|0|'My exalted friend and brother, did you hear what the Baby said to me?
CJ|0|153|3|0|Did you hear how He for once said right out: I, your Lord and your God! -?
CJ|0|153|4|0|If I add His willpower and the servants from the heavens of heavens who always fall down on their faces when the little one speaks, then the child is truly the only, eternal, veritable God and Creator of the world and of all things in it!
CJ|0|153|5|0|Friend, brother, what do you say to this my testimony? Is it not thus? Or is it otherwise?'
CJ|0|153|6|0|Here Joseph was taken somewhat aback himself, for he did indeed hold the Child to be a perfect Son of God. but he did not hold Him to be the Deity Himself.
CJ|0|153|7|0|He therefore replied after a while, 'To consider the Child to be God Himself might be assuming too much.
CJ|0|153|8|0|For the Jews are after all children of God - and therefore are also sons of God!
CJ|0|153|9|0|And that dates back to the days of father Abraham who was also a son of God as were his descendants.
CJ|0|153|10|0|Besides, we have always had big and little prophets who, when they spoke, spoke from God, and God foretold judgments and spoke through them constantly in the first person.
CJ|0|153|11|0|Thus the Lord once spoke through Isaiah: For I am the Lord your God, who sets the sea in motion that its waves rage. My name is: Lord Zebaoth.
CJ|0|153|12|0|I put My word in your mouth and cover you under the shadow of My hands, so I may plant heaven and establish the earth and speak to Zion: you are My people!
CJ|0|153|13|0|'See, even though the prophet spoke like that in the first person as if he were the Lord himself, he nevertheless is not the Lord, for it is only the Lord's Spirit that speaks thus through the prophet's mouth!
CJ|0|153|14|0|So you see, this must also be the case here. God is awakening a truly mighty prophet in this Child and already speaks through His mouth at an early age as once through the boy Samuel!'
CJ|0|153|15|0|Cyrenius was satisfied with this for the time being, but the Baby called Joseph and Cyrenius over and said to Joseph:
CJ|0|153|16|0|'Joseph you well know that the Lord spoke through the mouth of the prophets mostly as if in the first person.
CJ|0|153|17|0|But are you not familiar with what the Lord on one occasion speaks through Isaiah when He says:
CJ|0|153|18|0|'Who is He that comes from Edom, with reddish clothes from Bazra? Who is so greatly adorned in His garments and paces about in His great power? -
CJ|0|153|19|0|It is I, who teach justice and am a Champion to help!
CJ|0|153|20|0|Why is Your garment so red and Your dress like his that treads in the winepress? -
CJ|0|153|21|0|I tread the wine-press alone and none is with Me among the nations! I trod them underfoot in My wrath!
CJ|0|153|22|0|Therefore their power is spattered upon My garments, and I defiled all My garments!
CJ|0|153|23|0|For I have determined upon a day of vengeance; the year to redeem My own is come!
CJ|0|153|24|0|For I looked about but there was no helper; I was in terror but no one rescued Me - instead My arm had to help Me, and my anger restrained Me!
CJ|0|153|25|0|Therefore I have trampled the nations underfoot in My anger and have made them drunk in My wrath and have struck their power to the ground!
CJ|0|153|26|0|'Joseph, do you know Him who comes from Edom and now has come and speaks to you: I am He who teaches justice and am a Champion to help!- ?'
CJ|0|153|27|0|At these words Joseph laid his hand on his breast and inwardly worshiped the Baby.
CJ|0|153|28|0|After a while Cyrenius said to Joseph very quietly, 'Brother! In these for me of course too lofty words of the Baby it seems to me as if I were right after all!'
CJ|0|153|29|0|And Joseph admitted, 'Yes, you are right - but you must now be all the more concerned in keeping silent about it if you want to live!' - And Cyrenius inscribed this admonition deep in his heart and heeded it his whole life long.
CJ|0|154|1|1|A Friend Of The Question
CJ|0|154|1|0|AFTER THIS the captain came over to Cyrenius and asked him how many soldiers he should detail to the citadel to serve him in the evening.
CJ|0|154|2|0|The captain made this inquiry because he knew that this very evening Cyrenius would have his baggage brought aboard ship, as well as foodstuffs for several hundred persons whom he was taking along from Ostracine to Tyre.
CJ|0|154|3|0|Cyrenius looked at the captain and replied, 'My dear friend, if I should concern myself with that only now, the matter would have been managed very poorly.
CJ|0|154|4|0|The provisioning of the new ship which will take on these poor will be so taken care of still today that none of the travelers will lack anything.
CJ|0|154|5|0|Did you not see how quickly the old Carthaginian ship was made seaworthy by the youths?
CJ|0|154|6|0|See, in the same manner it can and also will be provisioned with everything for a year,
CJ|0|154|7|0|But concerning my own ships, they have already had a year's supply of everything for a long time, and this for a thousand men in the most severe case.
CJ|0|154|8|0|For that reason no man shall now be burdened on my account, but shall remain at the task to which he is assigned in the name of the emperor."
CJ|0|154|9|0|This answer surprised the captain, since Cyrenius otherwise paid great attention to military attend-liveness.
CJ|0|154|10|0|He thereupon asked Cyrenius, 'Your imperial, consular highness! Who really are these youths? Are they true Egyptian magicians, or are they perhaps hall-gods or famous Magi and astronomers from Persia?'
CJ|0|154|11|0|Cyrenius replied, 'My dear friend, here is neither the one nor the other.
CJ|0|154|12|0|If you really want to know who these youths are then go over and ask one of them, and you will get to the bottom of the matter through no fault of mine.'
CJ|0|154|13|0|Here the captain bowed before Cyrenius and promptly turned to one of the youths present and asked him,
CJ|0|154|14|0|'Listen to me, my most gentle, most charming, most beautiful, quite enchanting, beyond all my concepts magnificent, immeasurably tender - you who lame my tongue with your incredible beauty - m-m-most bewitching - youth!
CJ|0|154|15|0|Well, - about - what did - did - did I - actually want to ask?'
CJ|0|154|16|0|And the youth, who with the exception of the glory transcended into full heavenly beauty, thereupon answered the captain,
CJ|0|154|17|0|'You must surely know that? Just ask away, o friend of the question. I will of course be glad to answer you in everything.'
CJ|0|154|18|0|But the captain was completely carried away by the too great beauty of the youth and could not bring a word to his lips.
CJ|0|154|19|0|After a while, when he had looked his fill at the for him incredible beauty of the youth, he asked the youth for a kiss.
CJ|0|154|20|0|And the youth kissed the captain and said, 'Herewith a bond between us for always! - Now you just seek the closer acquaintance of yonder wise Jew, and you will receive much light!'
CJ|0|154|21|0|The captain thereupon fell so terribly in love with this youth that he could not help himself for all his love, and quite forgot his question.
CJ|0|154|22|0|This love tormented him until evening and was a little punishment for his love of asking questions. But in the evening he was healed again and had no more desire to approach such a youth.
CJ|0|155|1|1|Cyrenius Prepares His Departure
CJ|0|155|1|0|IN THE EVENING another meal was prepared and consumed, whereupon preparations were made for the departure on the following day.
CJ|0|155|2|0|Now Cyrenius and his suite knew that the new Carthaginian ship was still not ballasted nor provisioned, and Cyrenius was in fact secretly somewhat worried about it.
CJ|0|155|3|0|But a youth went over to him and said, 'Cyrenius Quirinus, you shall not worry about anything even in secret.
CJ|0|155|4|0|See, that which now concerns you has long been well taken care of.
CJ|0|155|5|0|Just have this house put in good order during your absence and we will surely take care of everything else in the name of the Lord God Zebaoth!'
CJ|0|155|6|0|Cyrenius believed - and ceased to worry about anything that concerned the care of the ships.
CJ|0|155|7|0|Thereupon Cyrenius called the captain over and put him in charge of the care and management of the citadel.
CJ|0|155|8|0|When the captain had again taken up his usual duty,
CJ|0|155|9|0|Cyrenius called the commander over and again gave him full authority over the military forces stationed in this city.
CJ|0|155|10|0|For with the Romans a local commander was not permitted to give orders according to his own judgment in the presence of the governor who then was the only authority.
CJ|0|155|11|0|When Cyrenius was through making arrangements, he went over to Joseph and said,
CJ|0|155|12|0|'My truly exalted, yes I would say, my divine friend and brother! How many things do I now have to thank you and most especially your most holy Baby for!
CJ|0|155|13|0|How, when, with what will I ever be able to pay you back this great debt?
CJ|0|155|14|0|You have given me Tullia, and have wonderfully saved my life!
CJ|0|155|15|0|Truly, I cannot even count up all the extraordinary and miraculous good deeds which you have accorded me during the short time that I was here.'
CJ|0|155|16|0|And Joseph said, 'Friend, how long has it been since I was in great trouble?
CJ|0|155|17|0|At that time you were sent to meet me as a rescuing angel of the Lord at Tyre.
CJ|0|155|18|0|See, thus one hand constantly washes the other in the great body of humanity.
CJ|0|155|19|0|But let us speak no more about that. See, evening is here. The villa lies an hour outside the city, so let me depart now and make my way homeward.
CJ|0|155|20|0|You and your companions have mine and the Lord's blessing manifold, so you may depart from here in good cheer.
CJ|0|155|21|0|And take the three lions into your ship - they will render you good service.
CJ|0|155|22|0|For you will run into a storm and will be driven off course toward Crete, and the rapacious Cretans will suddenly fall upon you.
CJ|0|155|23|0|At that time the three lions will again be of good service to you.'
CJ|0|155|24|0|At this Cyrenius was disheartened, but Joseph comforted him and assured him that no one would suffer the least harm.
CJ|0|156|1|1|Good Friends Take Leave
CJ|0|156|1|0|THEREUPON MARONIUS PILLA with the three priests came to Joseph and thanked him for all the wondrous deeds of kindness.
CJ|0|156|2|0|Joseph then cautioned him to be silent about all the things that he had seen here,
CJ|0|156|3|0|and Maronius as well as the three priests pledged most solemnly to do this.
CJ|0|156|4|0|Next came Tullia, fell down before Mary and dissolved in tears of gratitude.
CJ|0|156|5|0|And Mary, while holding the Baby, bent over and lifted up Tullia and said to her,
CJ|0|156|6|0|'Be blessed by me in the name of Him who rests upon my arms! Always be thankful in your heart, remembering this Child, and you will find your salvation in Him.
CJ|0|156|7|0|But put a bridle on your tongue and betray us to no one!
CJ|0|156|8|0|For when the time is ripe, the Lord will indeed reveal Himself before the world!'
CJ|0|156|9|0|Thereupon Mary took leave of the still sobbing Tullia.
CJ|0|156|10|0|Joseph now reminded Cyrenius, 'Friend, see, many of your company were witnesses of many a miracle. Request them for the sake of their own salvation to also be silent about all this.
CJ|0|156|11|0|For every betrayer of this wholly divine matter will meet death if he is not willing to be silent!'
CJ|0|156|12|0|This Cyrenius pledged Joseph to do and assured him that no one would ever learn a syllable.
CJ|0|156|13|0|Here Joseph praised Cyrenius and finally reminded him of the promised eight children which consisted of five boys and three girls.
CJ|0|156|14|0|And Cyrenius said, 'Oh friend, that will indeed be my first concern!
CJ|0|156|15|0|But now just one more question: See, I shall have to go to Rome still this year because of Tullia!
CJ|0|156|16|0|My brother Augustus Caesar has, as you know, already learned a few things from me and will surely ask me about several others.
CJ|0|156|17|0|What shall I tell him? To what extent may I initiate this noble man into this secret?'
CJ|0|156|18|0|Here Joseph answered, 'You can inform him about quite a few things, but only between the two of you.
CJ|0|156|19|0|And remind him that he, if he is silent, will remain undisturbed in his imperial dignity as well as his descendants.
CJ|0|156|20|0|But if he will let out only one syllable anywhere, God will promptly punish him!
CJ|0|156|21|0|For if he rebels against the Almighty, he along with all of Rome will perish instantly!'
CJ|0|156|22|0|Cyrenius thanked Joseph fervently for this instruction, whereupon Joseph blessed him and then returned to the villa with his family.
CJ|0|157|1|1|The Baby Becomes Silent
CJ|0|157|1|0|OUTSIDE THE CITY Mary gave the Baby over to James, for she had become tired since she had carried Him on her hands the whole day long.
CJ|0|157|2|0|And James was filled with joy because he once again had a chance to carry his Darling.
CJ|0|157|3|0|Here the Baby opened His eyes and said, 'My dear James, you really do love Me with all your heart!
CJ|0|157|4|0|But if I should become quite heavy for you, would you then still love Me as much?'
CJ|0|157|5|0|James answered, 'Oh my dearest little Brother, even if You weighed as much as I did, I still would carry You on my arms with a heart burning most fervently!'
CJ|0|157|6|0|The Baby continued: 'My brother, now of course I will not become heavy for you,
CJ|0|157|7|0|but one day the time will come in which I will become a great burden to you!
CJ|0|157|8|0|Therefore you do well that you are even now lovingly getting used to My weight,
CJ|0|157|9|0|for when accordingly the difficult time comes, you then will carry Me in My full weight just as easily as you carry Me now.
CJ|0|157|10|0|And I say to you: Everyone who does not first carry Me as a Child will one day succumb beneath My full weight!
CJ|0|157|11|0|'Whoever will carry Me in his heart as a weak little Child as you now do upon your hands, to him I shall be just as light a burden in the years of My manhood!'
CJ|0|157|12|0|James, not understanding these high words, caressingly asked the Baby,
CJ|0|157|13|0|'Oh my dearest little Brother, my Jesus, will You then allow Yourself to be carried around as a man?'
CJ|0|157|14|0|The Baby replied: 'You love Me with all your might, and that is enough for Me!
CJ|0|157|15|0|And your artlessness is more pleasing to Me than the wisdom of the wise who calculate much and make predictions, but whose hearts are colder thereby than ice.
CJ|0|157|16|0|What you do not grasp now, that you will grasp very easily at the proper time.
CJ|0|157|17|0|See, now I am still only a Child who is of an altogether minor age,
CJ|0|157|18|0|and behold, for all that my tongue is loosed and I converse with you as if I were a mature man!
CJ|0|157|19|0|Now if I were to remain like this, I would be like a dual being, a Child to the eye - and a Man to the ear.
CJ|0|157|20|0|But matters cannot continue as they are. I shall bind My tongue for a year to all but you.
CJ|0|157|21|0|and you will hear My voice only in your heart!
CJ|0|157|22|0|When I shall again speak with the mouth, your eye will see Me more matured, but your ear will hear only childish talk from Me!
CJ|0|157|23|0|I have told you this now so you will not take exception to Me then. So be it!'
CJ|0|157|24|0|Here the Baby again became quite speechless and behaved just like any other baby, while in the meantime they reached the villa.
CJ|0|158|1|1|The Meaning Of True Rest On The Sabbath
CJ|0|158|1|0|UPON ARRIVING at the villa, Joseph at once told his four oldest sons to look after the animals and then to soon retire.
CJ|0|158|2|0|This the sons did, but they soon returned and reported to Joseph,
CJ|0|158|3|0|'Father, it is amazing: The cattle as well as the donkeys are now fed and watered, but their cribs are still filled and the water buckets are full to the brim. How is that possible?'
CJ|0|158|4|0|Here Joseph went to look for himself and found the declaration of the four sons confirmed.
CJ|0|158|5|0|Therefore he returned and asked the still present youths whether they had done this on the Sabbath.
CJ|0|158|6|0|The youths answered in the affirmative, and Joseph very doubtfully asked the youths,
CJ|0|158|7|0|'How is it that you are servants of the Lord and are not inclined to keep the Sabbath holy?'
CJ|0|158|8|0|Gabriel thereupon replied: 'Oh you chaste man, how can you put such a question to us?
CJ|0|158|9|0|Did this day not elapse like any other? Did the sun not rise and set like on any other day? Did not the morning - noon - and evening wind blow today?
CJ|0|158|10|0|When we stood by the sea, did you not see the active motion of its waves? Why then would it not observe the Sabbath?
CJ|0|158|11|0|How could you walk, eat and drink and draw breath today - and did not prohibit your heart from beating?
CJ|0|158|12|0|'See, you Sabbath-fearing man, everything that is and happens in the world actually exists only through the power of activity bestowed upon us by the Lord and is led and governed by us!
CJ|0|158|13|0|Now if we would rest throughout one day, say, would not the whole creation quickly perish?
CJ|0|158|14|0|See, thus we must keep the Sabbath only by our labor from our love to the Lord, but not in idle inactivity.
CJ|0|158|15|0|'True rest in the Lord thus consists in true love of the heart towards Him and in uninterrupted activity accordingly, so God's eternal order may be upheld.
CJ|0|158|16|0|Everything else is an abomination before God full of human folly.
CJ|0|158|17|0|Consider this well and do not on any Sabbath shy away from doing good, and you will fully resemble the Lord, your as well as my Creator!'
CJ|0|158|18|0|Following this talk all the youths fell down on their faces before the Baby and thereupon disappeared.
CJ|0|158|19|0|And Joseph engraved these words deep in his heart and afterwards was not so scrupulous on a Sabbath.
CJ|0|159|1|1|Eudokia Learns A Secret of the Heavens
CJ|0|159|1|0|WHEN THE YOUTHS had disappeared, Eudokia asked Mary just who these youths actually were.
CJ|0|159|2|0|For Eudokia was still a pagan and knew nothing of the extraordinary secrets of the heavens.
CJ|0|159|3|0|That on this occasion the pagans also saw the angels was because their inward eye was kept open during this time,
CJ|0|159|4|0|and the disappearance of the angels therefore was nothing else than the closing of the inward spiritual vision -
CJ|0|159|5|0|for which reason it also seemed to Eudokia after their disappearance as if she had awakened from a deep sleep.
CJ|0|159|6|0|She now felt quite natural again and everything she had seen, heard and done throughout the whole day seemed to her like a most vivid dream.
CJ|0|159|7|0|Her question to Mary is thus understandable,
CJ|0|159|8|0|since she now perceived with her natural senses again.
CJ|0|159|9|0|Mary therefore said to her, 'Eudokia, we shall be together for still some time, and everything which at present seems obscure to you will become plain.
CJ|0|159|10|0|But for today let us go to rest, for I am very tired.'
CJ|0|159|11|0|Eudokia appeared to be satisfied with this consolation, but her eagerness to know grew in her heart.
CJ|0|159|12|0|Joseph now said, 'My children, night has come. Lock the gates and go to rest.
CJ|0|159|13|0|For tomorrow is anyhow the after-Sabbath on which we do not work. Then we can still discuss this and that.
CJ|0|159|14|0|But for today praise the Lord, and do as I have requested of you.
CJ|0|159|15|0|You, James, prepare the crib now, then bring the Baby to bed and place the crib next to the mother's couch.
CJ|0|159|16|0|And you, Eudokia, go to your bedroom also, and refresh yourself with sweet sleep in the name of the Lord.'
CJ|0|159|17|0|Eudokia now went directly into her bedroom and lay down on the couch, but sleep would not come,
CJ|0|159|18|0|for her fiery heart was too stirred up at the disappearance of the youths,
CJ|0|159|19|0|and she had fallen in love with Gabriel and now could not help nor console herself, since the object of her heart had so suddenly disappeared before her eyes.
CJ|0|159|20|0|When all rested and slept, Eudokia arose, opened a window and looked out.
CJ|0|159|21|0|Here Gabriel suddenly stood before her and admonished her, 'You must put your heart to rest.
CJ|0|159|22|0|See, I am not a human being like you, but am only a spirit and am a messenger of God.
CJ|0|159|23|0|And worship the Baby, for He is the Lord! He will bring peace to your heart!' - Thereupon the angel disappeared and Eudokia obtained peace.
CJ|0|160|1|1|I Am He, Who Teaches Justice
CJ|0|160|1|0|IN THE MORNING an hour before sunrise everyone in Joseph's house was up as usual and the Baby Himself kicked about quite gayly in His crib and let Himself be heard by joyful baby-tones as if He were half singing.
CJ|0|160|2|0|James played with the Baby in his usual way and made various motions with his hand for the Lord of infinity and sang and whistled thereby.
CJ|0|160|3|0|Mary was still on her couch and slumbered, wherefore Joseph, who was engrossed in his morning prayer, criticized James a bit since he was so noisy and paid no attention to the prayer nor to the slumbering mother.
CJ|0|160|4|0|Here James excused himself and said, 'Dear father, see, the Lord of heaven and earth is after all pleased by my activity with Him!
CJ|0|160|5|0|And we certainly should always do that which pleases the Lord!
CJ|0|160|6|0|See, the Lord is pleased with what I am doing. Why then are you displeased with it?
CJ|0|160|7|0|Now mother would surely not slumber as well if we two, the Baby and I, were not thus noisy.
CJ|0|160|8|0|I beg you, dear father, to consider me excused in that and not to blame me further if I in my calling sometimes seem unrestrained to you, but still please the Lord thereby.'
CJ|0|160|9|0|Joseph agreed, 'Yes, yes, everything is all right - and I like to see that you keep the Baby good company,
CJ|0|160|10|0|only you must not make so much noise in the future when you see that someone still sleeps and someone else is engrossed in prayer to God!'
CJ|0|160|11|0|James thanked Joseph for this admonition, then asked him, saying:
CJ|0|160|12|0|'When you pray to God, as you just have done, to what sort of a God do you pray?
CJ|0|160|13|0|From what I now know about this Baby, no other greater or more true God can possibly exist than this Baby following the most emphatic witness from the heavens!
CJ|0|160|14|0|And if-according to the prophets and according to the many marvelous testimonies - that is the case?
CJ|0|160|15|0|When it is stated by the prophet: Who is He that comes from Edom, with reddish clothes from Bazra? Who is so adorned in His garments and walks about in His great power? - It is I, who teach justice and am a Champion to save!
CJ|0|160|16|0|'Father, the Baby yesterday referred to Himself with these words in front of you. Just who is He? For no child of man can speak thus of Himself. And there is only one God!
CJ|0|160|17|0|Who then is the Baby that here says: I am He who teaches justice and am a Champion to save?'
CJ|0|160|18|0|Here Joseph was taken aback and admitted, 'Truly, my son James, you are right - you are better off at the cradle than I here in my prayer-nook!'
CJ|0|160|19|0|While they were speaking, Eudokia came out of her chamber filled with the highest ecstasy. She was as beautiful as the red glow of morning, and fell down before the crib and worshiped the Baby.
CJ|0|160|20|0|When she had thus prayed for half an hour, she arose and declared: 'Yes, - yes, You alone are the One, and apart from You there is no other!
CJ|0|160|21|0|Last night in a dream I saw a sun in the firmament, and it was empty and had little light.
CJ|0|160|22|0|Then I saw this Baby on the earth, and He shone like a thousand suns, and a powerful ray went out from Him over to the empty sun and illuminated it through and through.
CJ|0|160|23|0|In this ray I saw the angels which were here soar up and down - their number was infinite, and their faces were incessantly turned toward the Baby! Ah, how majestic that was!'
CJ|0|160|24|0|This tale brought Joseph completely out of his prayer-nook, and he now also held the Baby in greatest esteem and often prayed at the crib.
CJ|0|161|1|1|A Blind Man Receives His Sight
CJ|0|161|1|0|AT THIS TIME Mary also awoke, rubbed the sleep from her eyes, promptly arose and washed herself and exchanged the nightgown for her daytime dress in the small side chamber.
CJ|0|161|2|0|Then she returned resembling an angel of heaven, so beautiful, so good, so devout and so concernedly resigned to the will of the Lord.
CJ|0|161|3|0|She greeted Joseph and kissed him, then embraced Eudokia and kissed her.
CJ|0|161|4|0|After this most friendly greeting, which always cost the aged Joseph a few tears of joy, Mary - humbling herself in her heart to the greatest extent - full of love knelt down by the crib and while praying gave her breast to the Baby.
CJ|0|161|5|0|After the Baby was nursed, Mary promptly had a fresh bath prepared and bathed Him as usual.
CJ|0|161|6|0|And the Baby cheerfully kicked about in the bath-basin and industriously made His inarticulate voice heard.
CJ|0|161|7|0|When He was bathed and dried and again put into fresh little garments and foot wrappings,
CJ|0|161|8|0|Mary asked the Baby how He felt and whether the fresh little garments made Him feel good.
CJ|0|161|9|0|For she well knew that the Baby could speak, and that with divine wisdom. But she did not know and no one except James knew that the Baby had again bound His tongue.
CJ|0|161|10|0|Hence all considered it strange that the Baby gave no answer to Mary's questions.
CJ|0|161|11|0|Mary thereupon implored the Baby to speak only a little, but the Baby occupied Himself with His inarticulate voice in which there was no semblance of a word.
CJ|0|161|12|0|That disquieted Mary as well as Joseph and they wondered if perhaps the angels had not taken the Child of God into heaven during the night and left just an ordinary child in the crib in His place.
CJ|0|161|13|0|For the belief that children were interchanged was quite common among the Jews.
CJ|0|161|14|0|Mary as well as Joseph regarded the Baby quite concernedly, wondering if in fact He was the same,
CJ|0|161|15|0|but could not discover the least dissimilarity, neither about the head nor anywhere else.
CJ|0|161|16|0|Here Mary said, 'Save the bathwater, and look for someone that is sick and bring him here.
CJ|0|161|17|0|For up to now this water has always had a miraculously healing power.
CJ|0|161|18|0|If the sick one gets well, we still have our Baby, and if he does not get well, it then has pleased the Lord to give us another child in place of His own!'
CJ|0|161|19|0|Here James wanted to speak but the Baby forbade him this with words clearly audible in his heart, and he remained silent.
CJ|0|161|20|0|Thereupon Joseph at once sent the oldest son into the city so he might bring back someone sick.
CJ|0|161|21|0|In an hour and a half he returned with a blind man, and Mary washed his eyes with the bathwater, but the blind man did not receive his sight.
CJ|0|161|22|0|This occurrence saddened Mary, Joseph, the four sons and Eudokia. Only James remained gay, and took the Baby and coaxed Him.
CJ|0|161|23|0|And the blind man grumbled, for he felt that he had only been hoaxed.
CJ|0|161|24|0|But Joseph consoled him and promised to provide for him for the rest of his life as recompense for this seeming hoax, whereat the blind man became calm again.
CJ|0|161|25|0|Joseph now noticed how happy James was and held this up to him as a sin against Joseph as his father.
CJ|0|161|26|0|But James said, I am happy because I know where I stand, but all of you sorrow because you do not know that. Do you not know that one should not tempt God?'
CJ|0|161|27|0|Here James breathed on the blind man, who instantly received his sight! All now gazed at James in astonishment and did not know what to think.
CJ|0|162|1|1|James Explains A Passage From David
CJ|0|162|1|0|AFTER A WHILE Joseph went closer to James and asked him from whence such power in his breath came.
CJ|0|162|2|0|And James answered, 'Dear father, I heard a voice within me which said to me:
CJ|0|162|3|0|Breathe the blind man in the face, and he will be given perfect sight again!
CJ|0|162|4|0|See, I steadfastly believed this voice within me, did according to its word, and the blind man sees!'
CJ|0|162|5|0|Joseph asked, 'That is no doubt as you have spoken,
CJ|0|162|6|0|but whence came the powerful voice within you? How did you hear it?'
CJ|0|162|7|0|The questioned James replied: 'Dear father, do you not see Him upon my arms who now plays with my curls?
CJ|0|162|8|0|I think He was the One who spoke this to me within me in such a wondrous way.'
CJ|0|162|9|0|Joseph continued to inquire of James saying,
CJ|0|162|10|0|'Do you really believe that the Baby is still the right one? Do you not think that He might have been interchanged on us?'
CJ|0|162|11|0|And James answered, 'Who or what power can there be that is able to trade off the Almighty?
CJ|0|162|12|0|The angels surely did always fall on their faces when the Baby spoke most marvelously - how then should they be able to act thus with Him, the Almighty?
CJ|0|162|13|0|I therefore hold the Baby to be the original and genuine One just as surely and truly as I have never believed in an interchange of children!'
CJ|0|162|14|0|Here Joseph said, 'My dear son, you have not given me a very firm proof of your faith here.
CJ|0|162|15|0|See, thus speaks David himself, when he says: Why do the heathen rage, and the people speak a vain thing?
CJ|0|162|16|0|The kings in the land rise up, and the lords counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed and say:
CJ|0|162|17|0|Let us rend His bands and throw from us His cord!
CJ|0|162|18|0|See, my son, the words are spiritual, and the kings are the powers, and the land is the great realm of the invisible powers! - But what do these have in mind? Of what do they speak?
CJ|0|162|19|0|Is not the possibility indicated therein that they can also lay their hands on the Lord?'
CJ|0|162|20|0|And James replied: 'Certainly, if the Lord should permit it.
CJ|0|162|21|0|But it already states in the beginning of this song, asking: Why do the heathen rage, and why do the people speak a vain thing?
CJ|0|162|22|0|Does not David actually wish to describe the impotence of such powers against the Lord?
CJ|0|162|23|0|For it does emphatically say farther down: But He who lives in heaven laughs at them and derides them!
CJ|0|162|24|0|He will speak to them one day in His anger, and with His wrath He will frighten them!
CJ|0|162|25|0|Dear father, I would say these two stanzas of the great singer of God sufficiently justify my belief.
CJ|0|162|26|0|For they are enough to tell me that the Lord always remains the Lord and no interchange can be carried out against Him!'
CJ|0|162|27|0|Joseph was amazed at his son's wisdom and with his whole house again went back to the acceptance of the genuine Baby and honored and praised God therefor.
CJ|0|163|1|1|The Arrival Of The Children From Tyre
CJ|0|163|1|0|THUS EVERYTHING in Joseph's house was back in its good old order again.
CJ|0|163|2|0|Joseph and his sons made all sorts of little wooden utensils and sold these to the inhabitants of the city at very reasonable prices.
CJ|0|163|3|0|This of course they did after first attending to their usual household duties.
CJ|0|163|4|0|Mary and Eudokia looked after matters of the household, made garments and sometimes also embroidered for wealthy families in the city.
CJ|0|163|5|0|For Mary was greatly skilled in all manner of artistic spinning and knitted whole garments;
CJ|0|163|6|0|and Eudokia was a good seamstress and knew how to handle a needle deftly.
CJ|0|163|7|0|Thus the family constantly earned for itself what was needed and also had enough to assist the poor in time of need.
CJ|0|163|8|0|It was three months before the eight children arrived from Tyre, led by trusted friends of Cyrenius,
CJ|0|163|9|0|who brought along an enormous allowance consisting of eight hundred pounds of gold.
CJ|0|163|10|0|Hereupon Joseph stated, 'The children I will indeed take, but the money I will not take, for on it lies the Lord's curse!
CJ|0|163|11|0|So just take it back again and give it to Cyrenius who will surely know why I can and may not accept it.
CJ|0|163|12|0|Deliver my blessing and my greeting to him,
CJ|0|163|13|0|and tell him that I accompanied him in the spirit on his journey homeward and was a witness of all that happened to him,
CJ|0|163|14|0|and have blessed him at all times where any danger threatened him.
CJ|0|163|15|0|He shall not be concerned over the loss of the three animals on the island of Crete, for thus has the Lord, whom he knows, willed it!'
CJ|0|163|16|0|Joseph then blessed the friends of Cyrenius and took over the eight children with great joy, who immediately felt very much at home in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|163|17|0|Thereupon the friends of Cyrenius again took the gold and quickly went back to Tyre.
CJ|0|163|18|0|Joseph praised God for the addition of these children to his care, blessed them and turned them over to Mary's guidance. For Mary was an extremely well versed school mistress, since she had been instructed in all manner of things in the temple.
CJ|0|163|19|0|And the children learned to read and write in Greek, Hebrew and also Latin.
CJ|0|163|20|0|For almost everyone had to be able to speak these three languages in that era and also write them on occasion, since the Roman language in that day was what the Gallic is today, and had to be included as part of a better education.
CJ|0|164|1|1|An Evil Spirit Is Dispossessed
CJ|0|164|1|0|FROM THIS TIME onward it was very quiet in Joseph's house and nothing miraculous took place.
CJ|0|164|2|0|This quiet state lasted for a full year, at which time the little Child could already walk by Himself and talk and play with the other eight children.
CJ|0|164|3|0|During this time a Negro family with a very sick child came into Joseph's house.
CJ|0|164|4|0|For this family had heard in the city that a miracle doctor was present in this house who healed all sicknesses.
CJ|0|164|5|0|The sick child was a boy of ten and was tormented most pitifully by an evil spirit.
CJ|0|164|6|0|The spirit gave the boy no rest night and day, threw him about, made his stomach swell up and thereby caused him unendurable pain.
CJ|0|164|7|0|At times he drove him into the water and at times into the fire.
CJ|0|164|8|0|But when this spirit found itself to be in Joseph's house, it was quiet and did not stir.
CJ|0|164|9|0|Joseph asked the boy's father, who understood Greek, about the particular circumstances of the boy,
CJ|0|164|10|0|and the father faithfully told Joseph all that had ever taken place with the boy from the beginning.
CJ|0|164|11|0|Thereupon Joseph called James, who as a sixteen-year-old youth was busying himself with the little Child as usual, and told him of the distress of this Negro family.
CJ|0|164|12|0|Hereat James turned to the little Child and caressed Him and talked to Him in his heart.
CJ|0|164|13|0|At this the little Child stated quite loudly in the Hebrew language:
CJ|0|164|14|0|'My brother! My time will not come for quite a while - but you go over to the sick boy whose race carries the sign of Cain,
CJ|0|164|15|0|touch him in the breast cavity with the index Finger of the left hand, and the evil spirit will promptly depart out of the boy forever!'
CJ|0|164|16|0|James quickly went over and did as the little Child had told him.
CJ|0|164|17|0|Here the evil spirit rent the boy for the last time and screamed:
CJ|0|164|18|0|'What do you terrible one want with me? Where shall I go now, since you drive me from my home ahead of time?'
CJ|0|164|19|0|And James declared: 'The Lord wills it! The sea is not far away - there, where it is deepest, you shall dwell at the bottom, and the slime shall be your dwelling place henceforth, Amen!'
CJ|0|164|20|0|Here the spirit left the boy who instantly became well.
CJ|0|164|21|0|Thereupon the family wanted to reward Joseph, but Joseph accepted nothing and let them depart in peace and praised God for the wondrous healing of this boy.
CJ|0|165|1|1|Christophorus - The Giant Fisherman
CJ|0|165|1|0|FROM THIS EVENT onward another half year went by very peacefully and nothing miraculous took place.
CJ|0|165|2|0|For the little Child by means of His inner power scrupulously avoided everything which might have given occasion for any miracle.
CJ|0|165|3|0|He was lively and played with the other children when these had time;
CJ|0|165|4|0|otherwise He much preferred to go about with James and talked with him quite intelligently when they were alone.
CJ|0|165|5|0|But with the other children He talked in the manner of a child two years old. -
CJ|0|165|6|0|In that region there lived an emigrant Jew who made fishing in the near-by sea his means of livelihood.
CJ|0|165|7|0|This Jew was of very great stature and was tremendously strong.
CJ|0|165|8|0|On the morning of a day before the Sabbath, soon after breakfast, James took the little Child and with Joseph's permission went to visit this Jew who lived a good hour away from Joseph's house in a straight line.
CJ|0|165|9|0|James went because this Jew had already invited him a number of times, and because the little Child had secretly told him to go there.
CJ|0|165|10|0|When James with the little Child arrived at the fisherman's house, the latter was highly pleased and promptly served James a well-prepared fish.
CJ|0|165|11|0|James ate thereof with great pleasure and gave especially selected little pieces to his little Brother to eat.
CJ|0|165|12|0|And the little Child ate the small portions which James put in His mouth with visible appetite.
CJ|0|165|13|0|This made the fisherman so happy that he was inadvertently touched to tears thereby.
CJ|0|165|14|0|James soon wanted to go home again,
CJ|0|165|15|0|but the fisherman entreated him to remain with him for the day.
CJ|0|165|16|0|'And in the evening,' he promised, I will carry you home along with your dearest little Brother!
CJ|0|165|17|0|See, you no doubt walked for an hour and a half because you had to walk around this inlet of the sea, which is very shallow throughout.
CJ|0|165|18|0|But I am nearly two fathoms tall - the water hardly comes up to my body in its deepest part.
CJ|0|165|19|0|I shall take you and the Child on my arm, wade through the inlet with you and will then bring you both home along with a generous number of the choicest fresh fish in a short quarter-hour.'
CJ|0|165|20|0|Here the little Child said, 'Jonathan, your intention is good, but what if I and My brother become too heavy for you?'
CJ|0|165|21|0|Jonathan smiled and replied, 'Oh my dear little Child, if both of you were a hundred times as heavy as you are, I still could carry you quite easily!'
CJ|0|165|22|0|And the little Child asserted, 'Jonathan, that remains to be seen. Just try to carry Me alone across and back through the inlet which is hardly fifty fathoms wide, and we shall see how your strength holds up for us both.'
CJ|0|165|23|0|Jonathan immediately agreed to this test, and with the consent of James took the little Child on his arm and waded with Him across the inlet of the sea.
CJ|0|165|24|0|The way across went passably, although Jonathan was greatly surprised at the heaviness of the little Child
CJ|0|165|25|0|But on the way back the little Child became so heavy that Jonathan found it necessary to take up a strong beam with which, by using it as a support, he was able to bring the little Child to shore only with the greatest difficulty in the world.
CJ|0|165|26|0|When he arrived there, he promptly set the little Child on the shore where James was waiting and declared, 'In Jehovah's name, what is this? The whole world cannot be heavier than this Child!'
CJ|0|165|27|0|And the little Child smilingly agreed: 'That is surely so, for you now have also carried far more than the whole world amounts to!'
CJ|0|165|28|0|And Jonathan, barely recovering, asked, 'How am I to take that?'
CJ|0|165|29|0|But James said, 'Dear Jonathan, take the fish and come along with us on dry land to our home and remain with us for the night. Tomorrow you will be enlightened about this.'
CJ|0|165|30|0|Thereupon Jonathan took three containers of the choicest fish and that morning accompanied the two home to Joseph who received him with great joy, for they had been schoolfriends in their childhood.
CJ|0|166|1|1|Why Jonathan Carried More Than The Whole World
CJ|0|166|1|0|JONATHAN GAVE the three containers of fish over to Joseph, with which he made him very happy, for Joseph was very fond of fish.
CJ|0|166|2|0|He then inquired of Joseph: 'My very dear childhood friend, do tell me what sort of a Child you have.
CJ|0|166|3|0|Surely, He is at the most two to three years old, but He speaks as sensibly as if He were a grown man!
CJ|0|166|4|0|And see here, I, who after all am able to carry two oxen under my arms like you can carry two lambs, wanted to keep James and the little Child with me for the whole day and wanted to bring them home to you in the evening by wading through the inlet with them.
CJ|0|166|5|0|'When I made this wish known to James, the little Child spoke to me and said to my not small surprise:
CJ|0|166|6|0|Jonathan, your intention is good; but what if we get too heavy for you? -
CJ|0|166|7|0|That I in the knowledge of my strength had to smile at this question of childish concern is obvious!
CJ|0|166|8|0|But the little Child said thereto, that remained to be seen. I should attempt to carry Him alone across and back through the inlet to convince myself if He might not become too heavy for me!
CJ|0|166|9|0|'With the permission of James I took the little Child on my arm and carried Him through the water.
CJ|0|166|10|0|The way across was still bearable - but on the way back I had to take a pole on which I supported myself, and only with the greatest difficulty in the world did I get to the opposite shore.
CJ|0|166|11|0|'For truly, dear friend, you can believe me, the Child was so terribly heavy that I actually believed the weight of a world lay on my arms!
CJ|0|166|12|0|When I reached the shore and had quickly given the little Child over to James and was recovering a bit,
CJ|0|166|13|0|I then asked James how it was that this Child weighed more than a world.
CJ|0|166|14|0|Here the Child again said unasked,
CJ|0|166|15|0|that I now had carried more than if I had carried a whole world! -
CJ|0|166|16|0|Friend, your James has been a witness to all that. Now I am asking you about it and declare:
CJ|0|166|17|0|What in Jehovah's name kind of a Child do you have? Truly, that belongs to the supernatural!'
CJ|0|166|18|0|Here Joseph cautioned Jonathan, 'If you could be as silent as a stone wall - contrariwise your life would be in great danger! - I would indeed tell you something, my old, most upright friend.'
CJ|0|166|19|0|And Jonathan took an oath and exclaimed, 'By God and all the heavens, I would rather die in the fire a thousand times than to ever betray you with a syllable!'
CJ|0|166|20|0|At this Joseph took him along on his favorite hill and told him the whole truth in the matter concerning the little Child, of which Jonathan did not know a syllable up to then.
CJ|0|166|21|0|And Jonathan, as soon as he had heard this presented in a brief manner, fell down on his knees and from the hill worshiped the little Child who just then was romping about in the center of the other eight children,
CJ|0|166|22|0|and declared at the end of his long prayer: 'Oh blissful joy of joys! My God, my Maker has visited me! I have carried Him who carries all the world and all the heavens, upon my arms! Oh endless grace of graces! Oh earth, are you then worthy of such grace? Yes, now I understand the words of the Child of God: You have carried more than a world!' - Thereupon Jonathan fell silent and for an hour long could not bring forth a word from his mouth in his great happiness.
CJ|0|167|1|1|The Child's Favorite Food
CJ|0|167|1|0|WHEN JONATHAN had completed his devotion in such a wholehearted manner, Joseph said to him,
CJ|0|167|2|0|'My very dear friend, you dwell alone in your hut with your three helpers.
CJ|0|167|3|0|Today on the day before the Sabbath you will not catch any more fish anyhow, so remain with me today as well as for the Sabbath tomorrow.'
CJ|0|167|4|0|Jonathan answered, 'Yes, my friend and brother, if the Child of God were not here I would indeed like to remain with you.
CJ|0|167|5|0|But you see, I am a sinful person and am unclean in all my parts and limbs,
CJ|0|167|6|0|and since I live among the heathen, I have hardly thought about the precepts of Moses and lived more like a pagan than a Jew.
CJ|0|167|7|0|Thus I cannot remain where the Most Holy One dwells.'
CJ|0|167|8|0|And Joseph said, 'Brother, your argument is good, but it is not acceptable with me!
CJ|0|167|9|0|See, the Lord, who shows himself so gracious even against all the heathen, will surely show Himself to be still more gracious to you, since you are a penitent Jew.
CJ|0|167|10|0|All you need is to love Him, and you may be sure that the Lord will also love you beyond measure.
CJ|0|167|11|0|You see, the eight children and Eudokia are pagans, and for all that the little Child associates with them and loves them beyond measure!
CJ|0|167|12|0|So He will also accept you ever so lovingly and will concern Himself with you as with His best friend.'
CJ|0|167|13|0|At these words Jonathan took courage and with Joseph again went down from the hill into the dwelling where the noon meal had long been prepared.
CJ|0|167|14|0|Joseph now called everyone to the table, and Mary took the little Child and as usual sat down at the table next to Joseph.
CJ|0|167|15|0|But the little Child did not want to partake of the milk dish prepared for Him.
CJ|0|167|16|0|Mary was concerned at this, for she supposed that something was wrong with the little Child.
CJ|0|167|17|0|Here the little Child said, 'Why are you concerned about Me?
CJ|0|167|18|0|See, Jonathan brought me a better food. This I shall eat, and this will truly satisfy My hunger.'
CJ|0|167|19|0|Mary thereupon thought the fish were meant which were put on the table last.
CJ|0|167|20|0|And the little Child stated: 'Mary, you did not understand Me.
CJ|0|167|21|0|For I do not mean the fish, although they naturally taste better than this milk of yesterday which has already gone sour, and which Joel took in place of fresh milk to cook a mush for me.
CJ|0|167|22|0|'But the great humility and the great love of Jonathan's heart, which he has already demonstrated to Me on a number of occasions without knowing Me, that is what I mean!
CJ|0|167|23|0|I tell you, Mary, Jonathan is a strong man in his limbs, but the love of his heart is still much stronger!
CJ|0|167|24|0|And this his love for Me is the hearty fare which now satisfies Me. I shall also eat of his fish, but I do not want this sour mush.' - This made Jonathan so happy that he began to weep aloud.
CJ|0|168|1|1|A Lesson In Love, Gentleness And Patience
CJ|0|168|1|0|HERE MARY tasted the mush which Joel had prepared for the little Child, and found that it was a bit sour and contained little gruel-like curds.
CJ|0|168|2|0|At this she promptly called Joel who was still quite busy frying fish in the kitchen.
CJ|0|168|3|0|When he came, Mary sternly rebuked him, saying, 'Joel, just taste this mush!
CJ|0|168|4|0|Do you really have so little regard for the Child, for father Joseph and for me, the loyal wife of your father, that you can do this to me?
CJ|0|168|5|0|Do our cows and goats not have any more fresh milk in their udders?
CJ|0|168|6|0|Why did you take yesterday's already sour milk, which one can drink cold when one is thirsty, but not when it is cooked because it then is harmful, especially for children?'
CJ|0|168|7|0|Joseph now also tasted the mush and was all ready to give Joel a dressing down;
CJ|0|168|8|0|but the little Child sat erect and protested: 'Oh you children of men, why do you want to outdo Me everywhere?
CJ|0|168|9|0|Was My remark about Joel not enough? Why do you want to fully condemn him after I have dealt with him?
CJ|0|168|10|0|'Do you suppose I have a liking for such severity on your part? - Oh no! I am pleased only with love, gentleness of manner and patience!
CJ|0|168|11|0|Joel, to be sure, made himself liable to rebuke through his carelessness,
CJ|0|168|12|0|which is why I promptly rebuked him with My critical remark. Now this rebuke is sufficient; to what purpose then is an additional rebuke and a dressing down on top of that?
CJ|0|168|13|0|Every father does right when he punishes the naughty little children with the rod, but he should always be a wise and gentle teacher to his grown-up sons.
CJ|0|168|14|0|'Only, if a son were to rebel against his father, he shall be threatened!
CJ|0|168|15|0|If he then changes his attitude, he shall be restored to the old harmony.
CJ|0|168|16|0|But if he does not change his attitude, he shall be expelled from the house of the father and driven from the land of his fathers.
CJ|0|168|17|0|Now Joel has not transgressed in anything, only his desire to prepare the fish did not leave him enough time to have milked a goat.
CJ|0|168|18|0|But from now on he surely will never do that again, so let everything be forgiven him.'
CJ|0|168|19|0|Thereupon the little Child called Joel over to Himself and admonished him, 'Joel, if you love Me as I love you, then do not cause your father and your mother any more such anxiety in the future!'
CJ|0|168|20|0|This so stirred Joel that he began to weep, and he fell on his knees and asked the little Child, Mary and Joseph for forgiveness.
CJ|0|168|21|0|And Joseph assured him, 'Arise, my son! What the Lord forgives you, that is also forgiven you by me and by mother.
CJ|0|168|22|0|Go now, and see how the fish are doing.'
CJ|0|168|23|0|To this the little Child quickly added, 'Yes, yes, do go, otherwise the fish will be overfried, and then they would not be good - for I want to eat of them Myself.'
CJ|0|168|24|0|This concern pleased the other eight children so well that they laughed aloud for joy.
CJ|0|168|25|0|And the little Child laughed with them quite heartily and put the entire company at the table in a very happy frame of mind, and Jonathan's eyes were filled with enraptured tears of joy.
CJ|0|169|1|1|Melchisedek, The King of Salem
CJ|0|169|1|0|SOON Joel brought in the fried fish and set them on the table.
CJ|0|169|2|0|Joseph now placed a generous portion in front of each one and did not forget himself either;
CJ|0|169|3|0|but as usual he did not give a portion to the little Child who naturally received His share from Mary's portion.
CJ|0|169|4|0|But this time the little Child was not satisfied therewith, and also wanted a whole portion.
CJ|0|169|5|0|Here Joseph said, 'But my dearest little Son, my Jesus, that would surely be too much for You.
CJ|0|169|6|0|In the first place You could not possibly eat it at all, and besides it would make You sick if You did eat it.
CJ|0|169|7|0|Now You can see that I gave Your mother a greater portion anyhow because she has to provide for You.
CJ|0|169|8|0|So do not concern yourself, my little Son - You will not come too short.'
CJ|0|169|9|0|And the little Child replied: 'That I know - and many other things besides, which you do not know.
CJ|0|169|10|0|But it still would have been fitting if you had also given the Lord of creation a whole portion.
CJ|0|169|11|0|Do you know who Melchisedek, the King of Salem, was? - You do not know!
CJ|0|169|12|0|But I know and tell you: The King of Salem was the Lord Himself - but apart from Abraham no one was permitted to have the least intimation thereof.
CJ|0|169|13|0|That is why Abraham bowed down to the earth before Him and voluntarily gave Him the tenth part of everything.
CJ|0|169|14|0|'Joseph, I am the same Melchisedek, and you are comparable to Abraham!
CJ|0|169|15|0|Why then do you not want to give Me the tithing of these good fish?
CJ|0|169|16|0|Why do you refer Me to the mother? Who made the fish, as well as the sea? Was it Mary or I, a King of Salem from eternity?
CJ|0|169|17|0|See, I am here in My own from eternity, and you are not even willing to set a whole portion of fish before Me? Now that is indeed rare!
CJ|0|169|18|0|'For that reason it will also come to pass that men will one day place far greater portions before the mother of My body than before Me.
CJ|0|169|19|0|And I shall have to wait for what is placed before the mother, and that will be far from the order of Melchisedek!'
CJ|0|169|20|0|At this Joseph did not know what he should answer thereto. He therefore promptly divided his portion and set the greater half in front of the little Child.
CJ|0|169|21|0|The little Child now said: 'Whoever gives Me anything and keeps a part for himself, he does not know Me!
CJ|0|169|22|0|Whoever wishes to give to Me, let him give Me everything - otherwise I will not accept it!'
CJ|0|169|23|0|Here Joseph most gladly also set his portion before the little Child.
CJ|0|169|24|0|Thereupon the little Child lifted His right hand, blessed the two portions and stated:
CJ|0|169|25|0|'Whoever gives Me everything, he wins a hundred-fold! Take the fish back again, Joseph, and eat! And give Me only what you have left over!'
CJ|0|169|26|0|Joseph now took the fish again and ate a great deal thereof; and when he could eat no more, so much was left over that it would have been enough for twelve people. And the little Child then ate of the remainder.
CJ|0|170|1|1|Great Thoughts Other Than Love Are Vain
CJ|0|170|1|0|AFTER THIS MEAL, during which Jonathan wept many tears of joy and also of remorse, Jonathan asked Joseph,
CJ|0|170|2|0|'Joseph, my old childhood friend, oh tell me truly how incomparably happy you must really be when you consider the greatness of your calling?
CJ|0|170|3|0|What do you feel when you look at the little Child and the living faith of your heart tells you: See, the little Child is God Jehovah Zebaoth,
CJ|0|170|4|0|who talked with Adam, with Enoch, with Noah, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob -
CJ|0|170|5|0|who delivered our fathers from this land's hard bondage through Moses, and Himself gave the Law in the desert
CJ|0|170|6|0|and for forty years fed the many people in the desert where nothing grows than only an occasional bush of thorns or a thistle,
CJ|0|170|7|0|who spoke through the mouth of the saints and prophets?
CJ|0|170|8|0|'Oh Joseph, say, oh tell me, what do you feel in the presence of Him who laid the foundations of heaven and earth?
CJ|0|170|9|0|Yes, who created the angels and made the first pair of human beings and gave them life with His living breath!
CJ|0|170|10|0|Tell me, when you think that over, is it possible for you to speak?
CJ|0|170|11|0|Does the beholding of the Child not bind your tongue to such an extent that you must remain silent in too great reverence for Him who always was?'
CJ|0|170|12|0|And Joseph answered Jonathan: 'You do right that you ask me thus;
CJ|0|170|13|0|but just consider for yourself - what shall I do? It is after all like that, and I must bear the Most High just as if He were something low - otherwise I could not possibly continue.
CJ|0|170|14|0|'See, God is after all God, and we are His creatures! He is everything, and we are all nothing!
CJ|0|170|15|0|This relationship is arithmetically correct - now can you even in your loftiest thoughts change anything in this relationship?
CJ|0|170|16|0|So you see, your questions are vain! Even if I had a heart as big as the earth and a head as big as the sky, and then would entertain thoughts and feelings before which all the angels would quake,
CJ|0|170|17|0|say, what service would I thereby render Him who carries the whole infinity in His right hand like I carry a grain of sand?
CJ|0|170|18|0|Would I thereby be more of a human being and God the less God?
CJ|0|170|19|0|'So you see, your question is vain! I can only love the little Child with all my strength and render Him the necessary service which He requires of me!
CJ|0|170|20|0|All other dealing in great thoughts I lay aside because I well know my greatest and loftiest thought to be an utter, vain nothing compared to God's greatness!'
CJ|0|170|21|0|This answer gave Jonathan thoughts of quite a different nature, and he afterwards asked Joseph no more such questions.
CJ|0|171|1|1|The Child Explains Messiah Passages In Isaiah
CJ|0|171|1|0|TOWARDS EVENING of this day which - as already stated - was the day before the Sabbath, James took the little Child and went up on Joseph's favorite little hill.
CJ|0|171|2|0|And Joseph and Jonathan soon followed the example of James and also went up the hill.
CJ|0|171|3|0|James, as usual, took some butter and honey along in a small jar and a piece of wheat bread for the little Child,
CJ|0|171|4|0|of which he now and then put a small portion into the little Child's mouth; for He preferred most of all a piece of bread with butter or honey.
CJ|0|171|5|0|Now when James set his jar on a little bench and gaily played about in the grass of the gentle hill with the little Child,
CJ|0|171|6|0|a few bees and flies quickly visited the jar and feasted in abandon on the sweet contents.
CJ|0|171|7|0|When Joseph noticed this, he called to James, 'Go and cover that jar with something, or its contents will soon be eaten up by bees and flies.'
CJ|0|171|8|0|And James went over quickly with the little Child and wanted to chase the guests from the jar, but they did not obey him.
CJ|0|171|9|0|At this the little Child said, 'James, give the jar to Me, and I will see whether the fly and the bee will also show themselves disobedient to Me!'
CJ|0|171|10|0|Here James gave the jar to the little Child, and the Child hissed with a three-fold tsh tsh - tsh into the jar, and the flies and the bees instantly departed.
CJ|0|171|11|0|Thereupon James gave the little Child a small piece of bread with butter and honey, and the Child took it and ate it with satisfaction.
CJ|0|171|12|0|Jonathan, who had just discussed the wisdom in the Egyptian symbols with Joseph, noticed this action, which seemed to be of very minor importance, and asked Joseph whether any sort of significance containing a higher wisdom could be attached thereto.
CJ|0|171|13|0|And Joseph answered, 'I would not think so, for not every insignificant action contains hidden wisdom.
CJ|0|171|14|0|As often as anyone puts butter and honey out in the open, bees and flies will always appear and eat thereof.
CJ|0|171|15|0|One might be able to use this occurrence, like thousands of others, as a parable at a good opportunity - but in itself this action is without meaning.'
CJ|0|171|16|0|The little Child now ran over to Joseph and gaily stated:
CJ|0|171|17|0|'My beloved Joseph, this time you are mistaken!
CJ|0|171|18|0|What do you read in Isaiah? Is it not written about Me as follows, Butter and honey shall He eat, so He will know to reject evil and choose good.
CJ|0|171|19|0|But before the Boy learns to reject evil and choose good, the land that you see desolate will be forsaken of its two kings.
CJ|0|171|20|0|And the Lord will send days upon you, upon your people and upon your father's house, which have not been since the time that Ephraim was separated from Judah by the king of Assyria.
CJ|0|171|21|0|For in that time the Lord will hiss the fly at the end of the waters in Egypt and the bee in the land of Assur.
CJ|0|171|22|0|See, Joseph, what is contained in the words of the prophet is also contained in this act.
CJ|0|171|23|0|But the time for the unveiling is still not here, although not far off!
CJ|0|171|24|0|Now do you know the Son of the prophetess, who was named Hastening to Booty, Speeding to Prey?
CJ|0|171|25|0|Do you know the Son to whom a virgin shall give birth and shall name Him Immanuel?37
CJ|0|171|26|0|See, all That am I! But you will not grasp that fully until I as Hastening to Booty, Speeding to Prey and as Immanuel will call father and mother from the height!'
CJ|0|171|27|0|Here the little Child ran back to James again. But Joseph and Jonathan gazed at each other in wide-eyed astonishment at the words of the little Child and at the remarkable actual concurrence of the recent action with the words of the prophet.
CJ|0|172|1|1|He Is A Sinner Who Has No Love
CJ|0|172|1|0|AFTER JONATHAN had somewhat recovered from his astonishment at these words of the little Child, he said to Joseph,
CJ|0|172|2|0|'Brother! Truly, as strongly as I have determined to stay with you today and tomorrow, I just will hardly be able to remain true to this intention.
CJ|0|172|3|0|You see, everything here just seems too holy to me. I feel as if I were in a desolate place here in which everything at which the wanderer looks calls out to him: Here is no place for you, but only for spirits.
CJ|0|172|4|0|'I also feel like someone on a very high mountain on whose summit the magic of the far vista at first enchants his senses;
CJ|0|172|5|0|but only too soon the very pure and cold aid tells him:
CJ|0|172|6|0|O lazy and impure human beast of burden, go back to your stinking homeland.
CJ|0|172|7|0|For here, where the purest spirits of the purest ether dwell, is no place for an impure soul.
CJ|0|172|8|0|How pure was the great prophet Moses, but when he wished to see the Lord, the Same declared to him:
CJ|0|172|9|0|Me, your God, you cannot see and live at the same time.
CJ|0|172|10|0|'Here is the same Lord in the fullness of His holiness; He is here, the One announced by the mouth of all the prophets!
CJ|0|172|11|0|How could it be possible for me to any longer bear His visible presence here, since I am after all an old sinner against the whole Law of Moses?'
CJ|0|172|12|0|And Joseph replied, 'Dear friend and brother, you well know what the main law is - why then would you rather go home than to honor this law by living according to it?
CJ|0|172|13|0|Love the Lord with all your might, and do not constantly think of your sins, and you will surely be more pleasing to the Lord than with your constant exclamations.
CJ|0|172|14|0|Wait until the little Child sends you away. When that happens, then believe that you are unworthy of Him;
CJ|0|172|15|0|but as long as that does not take place then remain - for you will eternally never be more at home anywhere than here.'
CJ|0|172|16|0|Here the little Child came over and said, 'Joseph, you did right in that you criticized Jonathan a bit - why is he so stubborn and does not want to stay here, when I love him so much!'
CJ|0|172|17|0|Thereupon the little Child turned to Jonathan and inquired,
CJ|0|172|18|0|'Jonathan, do you really want to leave here? What ill can possibly be happening to you, since you do not want to stay?'
CJ|0|172|19|0|Jonathan answered, 'My Lord and my God, see, I am after all a gross sinner against the Law!'
CJ|0|172|20|0|And the little Child said: 'What are you saying about sins? I do not charge you with any!
CJ|0|172|21|0|Do you know who is a sinner? - I tell you: He is a sinner who has no love.
CJ|0|172|22|0|But you have love, so you are no sinner before Me - for I have forgiven you your sins because I am a Lord from eternity above Moses!'
CJ|0|172|23|0|Here Jonathan wept and again decided to stay, and then went over to the little Child and caressed Him.
CJ|0|173|1|1|The Just According To The Law Will Weep
CJ|0|173|1|0|WHILE JONATHAN was thus fondling and caressing the little Child, He said to him,
CJ|0|173|2|0|'Jonathan, just try to carry me once more now, and I will surely not seem as heavy to you than across the inlet!'
CJ|0|173|3|0|And Jonathan, full of love and joy, took the little Child on his arms and found Him to be as light as down.
CJ|0|173|4|0|At this he asked the little Child, 'My Lord and my God, how on earth can I grasp that?
CJ|0|173|5|0|Over by the sea You were the burden of a world to me - but here You are as light as a feather!'
CJ|0|173|6|0|And the little Child answered: 'Jonathan, as it was with you, so it will be with everyone.
CJ|0|173|7|0|For My great burden lies not with Me, but with the Law of Moses!
CJ|0|173|8|0|When you did not know Me but only the Law, and carried Me upon your shoulder, it was not My burden but only the law's burden that pressed on your shoulder with the weight of a world.
CJ|0|173|9|0|But now you have recognized Me in your heart as the Lord over Moses and over the Law, and behold, the burden of the Law is no more with Me, the Lord of the Law!
CJ|0|173|10|0|And that is how all those who carry the burden of the Law will fare in the future according to the spirit!
CJ|0|173|11|0|'Truly I tell you: The just according to the Law will weep and gnash their teeth -
CJ|0|173|12|0|but the Lord will sit at the table in the houses of the sinners and will heal them and accept them as His children.
CJ|0|173|13|0|I shall seek the lost, I shall heal, redeem and set free the sick, those in hard bondage and the oppressed -
CJ|0|173|14|0|but the just according to the Law shall depart out ,of My house unjustified.
CJ|0|173|15|0|Truly I tell you: The tax collectors and sinners I shall praise in My house -
CJ|0|173|16|0|but the just I shall shoulder with a strong burden before Me in My house.
CJ|0|173|17|0|'Yes, a harlot shall anoint Me, and the guilt of an adulteress I will write in the sand, and the sinners shall touch Me -
CJ|0|173|18|0|but accursed shall be a preceptor of the Law and one learned in the Scripture so he touches Me!
CJ|0|173|19|0|Those whom the burden of the Law has killed, I shall pull out of their graves -
CJ|0|173|20|0|but for the preceptors of the letter of the Law I shall make the gateway to life as narrow as the eye of a needle!'
CJ|0|173|21|0|At these words Joseph was shocked and asked, 'But my dear little Child, what terrible things are You saying?
CJ|0|173|22|0|God after all gave the Law, so why should a sinner be better than one that is just?'
CJ|0|173|23|0|And the little Child replied: 'God has indeed given the Law - but only for the heart, and not for the wisdom of the world. Moses himself based the entire Law on love to God!
CJ|0|173|24|0|The Law has in fact remained - but love has long since died out.
CJ|0|173|25|0|For a law in which there is no more love is useless, and he who keeps it without love is a dead slave thereto.
CJ|0|173|26|0|That is why I prefer a pagan and a free sinner to a dead and bound slave to the Law.'
CJ|0|173|27|0|Here Joseph was silent and pondered over these words; and the little Child began to speak of childlike things again with Jonathan and His James.
CJ|0|174|1|1|The Nature Of The Moon
CJ|0|174|1|0|THAT EVENING the full moon had just 'risen over Ostracine,
CJ|0|174|2|0|and Jonathan admired its beautiful form from this hill, enjoyed its light and was altogether silent.
CJ|0|174|3|0|Joseph soon noticed this and asked Jonathan, 'Brother, just what do you see in the shining disk of the moon, since you observe it so attentively?'
CJ|0|174|4|0|And Jonathan answered, 'Actually I do not see anything at all - except the old, always the same spots.
CJ|0|174|5|0|But as often as I see the moon I always wonder what those spots might be and what the moon is anyway - why we sometimes do not see it at all, then like a sickle, and then again so and so.
CJ|0|174|6|0|If you know any more than that tell me about it, for I really like to hear about things like that.'
CJ|0|174|7|0|Here Joseph admitted, 'Dear friend, in this respect we both are quite alike,
CJ|0|174|8|0|and I am thus no better informed about the strange nature of this heavenly body than you are,
CJ|0|174|9|0|so I am able to tell you as good as nothing concerning this matter. The little Child will surely know more about it than I - so ask Him.'
CJ|0|174|10|0|Here Jonathan in a somewhat backward manner asked the little Child concerning the nature of the moon.
CJ|0|174|11|0|And the little Child answered: 'Jonathan, if I show you the moon, you then will also want to see the sun and after that the countless stars.
CJ|0|174|12|0|Tell Me, when will your desire to see come to an end?
CJ|0|174|13|0|Behold, much knowledge burdens the head and makes life on earth unpleasant.
CJ|0|174|14|0|But much love in your heart to God and your fellow men makes life on earth pleasant and takes away all fear of death.
CJ|0|174|15|0|For this love truly is eternal life in itself - and whoever has this will at some future time see the whole creation!
CJ|0|174|16|0|For those who truly love God will see His face! And that is the face of God which he created by His wisdom and by His eternal, infinite power.
CJ|0|174|17|0|For the face of God is wisdom and infinite power, just as love is His fundamental essence from eternity.
CJ|0|174|18|0|'But since you have already asked Me about the moon, I say this to you: it is a lesser earth and has mountains, valleys, fruits, animals and beings of your kind.
CJ|0|174|19|0|Now the part which you see is naked and void and has neither water nor fire.
CJ|0|174|20|0|Only the part which you do not see is like the earth.
CJ|0|174|21|0|The moon's light is from the sun, its brightness depends on its position and changes every minute according to its rotation around the earth. And its spots are deeper and darker places of trial.
CJ|0|174|22|0|Now you know what the moon is - are you satisfied therewith?' - And Jonathan affirmed this question and absorbed himself in deep thoughts.
CJ|0|175|1|1|An Historic Eclipse Of The Moon
CJ|0|175|1|0|WHEN MARY, assisted by Eudokia, had completed her household duties, she also went up on the little hill preceded by Eudokia.
CJ|0|175|2|0|Here the little Child ran towards her and danced joyously around His indeed lovely mother.
CJ|0|175|3|0|Mary now took the already fairly heavy little Child on her somewhat tired arms, caressed Him and jokingly said,
CJ|0|175|4|0|'My, but You are heavy today! You undoubtedly were two sweet-toothed and ate too much bread, butter and honey?'
CJ|0|175|5|0|The little Child answered, 'Oh, there was much to put away! Such a little jar that James can easily hide it in his fist!
CJ|0|175|6|0|Then a little piece of bread which one may not expose to the wind either, so it will not promptly be lifted up into the air like a dry leaf!
CJ|0|175|7|0|One certainly cannot put on much weight from that.
CJ|0|175|8|0|I must confess that I am really quite hungry and already look forward to the evening meal.
CJ|0|175|9|0|See, Joseph and Jonathan have already made a meal of the whole moon and are still hungry although they are grown -
CJ|0|175|10|0|how then should I have stilled My hunger with that fly's snack, when I still have to grow?'
CJ|0|175|11|0|And Mary said to the Child, 'My little Son, my, but You are really quite difficult again today!
CJ|0|175|12|0|See, if Joseph and Jonathan had made a meal of the moon, it surely would never shine down so beautifully from the sky!'
CJ|0|175|13|0|And the little Child said, 'Woman and mother! I am not being difficult - you just did not understand Me.
CJ|0|175|14|0|Now just go on over to the two, and they will promptly give you a taste of the moon also.'
CJ|0|175|15|0|Here Mary smiled and went over to Joseph, greeted him and asked him what he was so profoundly considering
CJ|0|175|16|0|and why he and Jonathan were so busily looking at the full moon.
CJ|0|175|17|0|But Joseph hardly looked around at Mary and replied, 'Just do not bother me in my observation,
CJ|0|175|18|0|for I want to decipher something now with Jonathan! Jesus has given us hints which must be worked out - so be quiet now and do not interrupt us.'
CJ|0|175|19|0|At this Mary looked at the little Child who was secretly smiling, and the little Child said,
CJ|0|175|20|0|'Now do you see how Joseph and Jonathan still feed on the moon? Just wait here patiently, and have James bring me a piece of bread and an orange.
CJ|0|175|21|0|For the feeding on the moon by Joseph and Jonathan makes Me still hungrier than I already am.'
CJ|0|175|22|0|Thereupon Mary quickly sent James and had him bring what the little Child wanted,
CJ|0|175|23|0|and then asked the little Child how long it would take for the two to finish their calculations about the moon.
CJ|0|175|24|0|And the little Child said: 'Just watch! Today - even right away, an eclipse of the moon will take place which will last about three hours!
CJ|0|175|25|0|Now those two do not know what causes this - therefore they will suppose that they have actually eaten up the moon, especially Jonathan.
CJ|0|175|26|0|And this phenomenon will put an end to this observation.
CJ|0|175|27|0|Afterward I shall of course instruct them again, as I usually do when it is necessary.
CJ|0|175|28|0|But first both must strongly miscalculate and see their calculations come to naught.'
CJ|0|175|29|0|Hardly had the little Child finished speaking these words, when the moon already showed a dark brown indentation.
CJ|0|175|30|0|Jonathan was the first to notice this and pointed it out to Joseph.
CJ|0|175|31|0|Joseph, in great surprise, noticed the same thing and still more, since the eclipse increased with every moment.
CJ|0|175|32|0|At this both were soon afraid, and Joseph quickly asked the Child, 'Child, what is taking place with the moon?'
CJ|0|175|33|0|Here the little Child said, 'You can see that I am eating, so why do you want to interrupt Me? Wait until I am through with the orange - as you with the moon, and I shall tell you more.'
CJ|0|175|34|0|Thereupon Joseph was silent, and when the moon became totally eclipsed, both became alarmed. Everyone now went into the house, while Jonathan seriously believed that he had eaten the moon.
CJ|0|176|1|1|Some Old Fables About The Moon
CJ|0|176|1|0|WHEN HE ARRIVED in the house, Jonathan said to Joseph, 'Brother, what will come of this most unfortunate situation?
CJ|0|176|2|0|By my poor life, just look out of that window! The whole moon has been eaten up hide and hair!
CJ|0|176|3|0|And it is now terrifyingly dark outside!
CJ|0|176|4|0|Yes, yes, I have often heard it said by greatly learned pagans that man should not count the heavenly orbs nor gaze at them too attentively -
CJ|0|176|5|0|for it then could easily happen that they would fall down to earth!
CJ|0|176|6|0|And if a man should happen to chance upon his own guiding star, and it fell down, the man would be lost and done for!
CJ|0|176|7|0|Now the moon is also a heavenly body and may be subject to the same strange law!
CJ|0|176|8|0|So it might be that we hit upon it and it fell down to earth somewhere in pieces; for I saw a number of particles fly away from it.
CJ|0|176|9|0|Or we are now bewitched by the moon and will become moonstruck, which will be a great affliction for us!
CJ|0|176|10|0|One thing is certainly the case: it is obvious that the moon does not exist any more - but who devoured it or where it went is quite another question!'
CJ|0|176|11|0|Here Joseph said, 'Do you know, I have heard a number of times that the moon as well as the sun become darkened.
CJ|0|176|12|0|Now that could easily be the case now, although I myself cannot recall ever having seen anything like it!
CJ|0|176|13|0|But I have heard from old people that at times the angels of God polish these two heavenly lights as we do a lamp, once the wick becomes defective -
CJ|0|176|14|0|during which time it naturally gets a bit dark on the earth. That may be happening now!
CJ|0|176|15|0|For the fable that a dragon begins to devour both heavenly bodies is too stupid and is nothing but paganism.'
CJ|0|176|16|0|While Joseph and Jonathan were thus discussing the moon, it began to re-emerge on the other side.
CJ|0|176|17|0|The children and the sons of Joseph noticed this and exclaimed, 'Look, look, the moon is becoming visible again!'
CJ|0|176|18|0|The pair looked outside, and a stone fell from Jonathan's heart because he now could see the moon again.
CJ|0|176|19|0|Here Joseph again asked the little Child how this came about.
CJ|0|176|20|0|And the little Child said, 'Just let the meager moon come out from behind the shadow which the earth casts, and then we will see if it has changed any!
CJ|0|176|21|0|The earth is after all no infinitely great body, but is as round as the orange which I ate a little while ago
CJ|0|176|22|0|and floats free in an infinite space; hence the sun's rays can always cover the earth.
CJ|0|176|23|0|Thus the great earth must also throw a shadow, and if the moon enters into this it is darkened, since it is also illuminated by the sun. Any more I shall not tell you!' At this Joseph and Jonathan looked at each other and could not think of anything to add thereto.
CJ|0|177|1|1|A Perfect Earth In Miniature
CJ|0|177|1|0|AFTER A WHILE Jonathan said to Joseph, 'Brother, now who would ever have let it enter his head, even in a dream, that the earth might be an enormously large globe.
CJ|0|177|2|0|So we inhabit only the surface of this globe?
CJ|0|177|3|0|But what about the sea? Does that also belong to the globe, or does the actual solid earth-globe float on it?'
CJ|0|177|4|0|Here the little Child bestirred Himself and stated, 'So all of you may not lose your beneficial sleep for all this futile speculation, I shall have to free you from your delusion!
CJ|0|177|5|0|Step closer, and you, James, hurry and bring another especially nice orange.'
CJ|0|177|6|0|When the orange was brought, the little Child took hold of it and said:
CJ|0|177|7|0|'Behold, that is the earth! I now want this orange to become a perfect likeness of the earth on a smallest scale with mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, oceans and also inhabited places built by men. So be it!'
CJ|0|177|8|0|At that moment there appeared on the hand of the little Child a perfect globe of the earth in miniature - which upon the 'So be it!' had in fact become a hundred times larger than the orange.
CJ|0|177|9|0|The ocean, the rivers, lakes, mountains as well as the cities were to be seen on this globe just as they actually were.
CJ|0|177|10|0|Everyone now pressed up close to look at this wonderful creation of the earth on a minute scale.
CJ|0|177|11|0|Joseph soon found Nazareth and Jerusalem thereon and was amazed at their perfect likeness.
CJ|0|177|12|0|Eudokia soon found Thebes in her homeland and was amazed at its perfect representation.
CJ|0|177|13|0|Thus Rome was also found as well as a great many other known localities.
CJ|0|177|14|0|The inspection of this globe lasted over an hour and seemed never to come to an end.
CJ|0|177|15|0|Even Mary enjoyed looking at this little earth so much that she became greatly animated by her observations.
CJ|0|177|16|0|And the eight children held their eyes glued to this miniature earth as if they had been turned to stone.
CJ|0|177|17|0|The little Child now explained the nature of the earth in great detail like a professor of geography, and all understood His words.
CJ|0|177|18|0|When the little Child had completed His explanation, He said to James,
CJ|0|177|19|0|'James, now take a string and hang this globe somewhere so it hangs free, that those thirsting after knowledge will find something to occupy them tomorrow also!
CJ|0|177|20|0|But for today let us forget this earth and go to rest after the evening meal;
CJ|0|177|21|0|for I have become hungry and thirsty during the time you fed on the moon and on the earth.'
CJ|0|177|22|0|Here Joseph immediately ordered the kitchen master Joel to prepare an evening meal and to put it on the table. And Joel went with the other three brothers and prepared a good evening meal.
CJ|0|178|1|1|Jonathan Is Called To An Important Service
CJ|0|178|1|0|WHEN THE EVENING MEAL had been prepared and eaten, Jonathan said to Joseph,
CJ|0|178|2|0|'Brother, you will not have enough room for me, so let me go home now during this fair night to where a sufficiently large couch is prepared for me.
CJ|0|178|3|0|Tomorrow I will be back here an hour before sunrise.'
CJ|0|178|4|0|Joseph replied, 'Brother, if you have no other concern than only for a sufficiently large resting place, you can make yourself at home here;
CJ|0|178|5|0|for there shall be no lack of that in this, now my house.
CJ|0|178|6|0|See, there in the outer court is a door on the left to a roomy side-chamber.
CJ|0|178|7|0|There I have already had a good resting place set up for you.
CJ|0|178|8|0|I am sure that it will be large enough for you, so you may just as well stay here.'
CJ|0|178|9|0|To this Jonathan said, 'Brother, you are very kind to me, and I now realize only too well that I am nowhere more at home than here,
CJ|0|178|10|0|and am also convinced that your resting place will accommodate me very well.
CJ|0|178|11|0|But something is now drawing me homeward with great urgency, and that all at once so strongly that I would rather fly there than go on foot as usual!'
CJ|0|178|12|0|When Joseph heard this, he said, 'Your will is your own and you can do what you will, so you can go or stay.'
CJ|0|178|13|0|Thereupon Jonathan went to the little Child and most humbly took his leave from Him.
CJ|0|178|14|0|'Here the little Child stated, 'Jonathan, if you absolutely want to leave you are free to go - but do not forget to come back!
CJ|0|178|15|0|Now I tell you that your plan to cast your big net tonight will avail you nothing.
CJ|0|178|16|0|Instead I shall drive a shark into your net that will torment you until sunrise and will tear up your best fishing gear in the morning.
CJ|0|178|17|0|And despite all that you will not catch him - for he will bring all your effort to naught with one slap of his tail into the water!'
CJ|0|178|18|0|When Jonathan heard this from the little Child, he suddenly changed his mind and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|178|19|0|'Brother, in that case I shall remain! See, tomorrow I wanted to bring you a big cask filled with the choicest fish -
CJ|0|178|20|0|and this thought drew me homeward so strongly.
CJ|0|178|21|0|But now that I have heard how this haul will turn out, I shall stay with you.
CJ|0|178|22|0|So have me brought to my couch where I shall sleep quite peacefully - and I do not care what happens at home!'
CJ|0|178|23|0|At this the little Child said: 'Jonathan, thus you please Me better than when you seek to conceal your heart!
CJ|0|178|24|0|But I now tell you: Go home! For at midnight you will do Me an important service.'
CJ|0|178|25|0|Thereupon Jonathan arose and hastened homeward, blessed by Joseph's entire household.
CJ|0|179|1|1|The Lucky Catch - An Omen For Jonathan
CJ|0|179|1|0|ACCORDING TO present-day calculations it was the tenth hour in the evening when Jonathan came home.
CJ|0|179|2|0|When he arrived there, he found his three helpers with their wives and children quite busy and heard them rejoice and speak among themselves as follows,
CJ|0|179|3|0|'It is well and good that our master went away and gave us a chance to show him what faithful servants we are to his house.
CJ|0|179|4|0|Today we caught a thousand pounds of tuna, a thousand pounds of sturgeon, three young sharks, ten swordfish, one dolphin and about two hundred pounds of choice smaller fish.
CJ|0|179|5|0|How happy he will be to find such a wealth of fish.'
CJ|0|179|6|0|Jonathan now made his presence known, and all ran towards him like children to their father and told him of the lucky catch.
CJ|0|179|7|0|Jonathan praised and kissed them and then said, 'Since you have already been so industrious today, go now and quarter the large fishes - namely the sharks, the swordfish, the dolphin and the sturgeons and bring them into the large smoke-shed.
CJ|0|179|8|0|Be sure to promptly make a strong smoke with a number of pleasantly scented shrubs so the fish will not spoil because of the heat, and rub especially the sharks and the dolphin well with salt, and do not spare the sea-onions and the thyme.
CJ|0|179|9|0|Then put the tuna and the other smaller fish into the large casks.'
CJ|0|179|10|0|And his chief helper assured him, 'Oh master, what you have now ordered done was already done during the day, and everything is in the best order.'
CJ|0|179|11|0|Here Jonathan went and convinced himself of everything and then declared, 'Children and brothers, that is no ordinary catch.
CJ|0|179|12|0|A higher power has helped here so let us wait until after midnight and see whether this higher power will not make use of our strength in return.
CJ|0|179|13|0|You have seen the full eclipse of the moon - that is a sure sign that a misfortune awaits someone still today! So let us wait until midnight and see if someone will not have need of our help.
CJ|0|179|14|0|Go now and ready the great boat that has a sail and ten strong oars for departure.
CJ|0|179|15|0|And the three helpers at once readied the boat.
CJ|0|179|16|0|Now they had hardly completed their task, when a mighty wind began to stir up the water of the sea.
CJ|0|179|17|0|Here Jonathan said to the three, 'Now we have no more time to lose! Call your ten sons and place them at the oars. You, fishing master, take the wheel, and I shall manage the two large forward oars myself.
CJ|0|179|18|0|Pull in the sail, since we have a contrary wind - and now let us go out on the high sea at once in the name of the Almighty!' -
CJ|0|179|19|0|When they had thus steered outward for at least an hour and had much trouble with the strong waves, they heard loud cries of fear coming from the high, mightily heaving sea.
CJ|0|179|20|0|At this they rowed with great vigor and in a quarter of an hour reached a large Roman ship which had run aground on a sandbar and had already been strongly tilted by the pressure of the waves.
CJ|0|179|21|0|Ropeladders were hastily thrown over the side of the Roman ship, and all the people - numbering about one hundred - were saved, in command of whom was none other than Cyrenius accompanied by Tullia and by Maronius Pilla.
CJ|0|180|1|1|A Great Reward For Jonathan
CJ|0|180|1|0|CYRENIUS NOW asked his gigantic rescuer where they were, and also for his name.
CJ|0|180|2|0|Jonathan answered, 'Sir, you must be a stranger, since this land which has so many characteristic features is unknown to you.'
CJ|0|180|3|0|And Cyrenius said, 'Friend, one region not seldom has a similarity with another, and in the twilight of the moon one may easily fail to recognize one's own homeland!
CJ|0|180|4|0|Besides, it is especially difficult to recognize a locality when one's feelings have first been stirred up by fear of death!
CJ|0|180|5|0|So you may as well tell me the name of this region into which the terrible storm has driven me.'
CJ|0|180|6|0|Jonathan now said, 'Good sir, you are surely familiar with the rule that one should not be too quick in telling someone just rescued where he is.
CJ|0|180|7|0|For if he is far from his destination, he becomes too depressed upon learning this too soon after withstanding great danger.
CJ|0|180|8|0|But if by some happenstance the storm does after all cast a rescued person close to the place of his destination, this sudden joy, after the recently withstood fear of death, could cost him his life!
CJ|0|180|9|0|Therefore the rescuer should at first be reserved and only after a while tell the rescued what they want to know.'
CJ|0|180|10|0|When Cyrenius heard this manner of reply from the to him still unknown rescuer, he admitted,
CJ|0|180|11|0|'Truly, you are a noble rescuer and have the right sort of wisdom along with it; so steer away that we may soon reach land.'
CJ|0|180|12|0|Here Jonathan announced, 'See, the bight is already reached! It branches off into a small arm at the end,
CJ|0|180|13|0|and if we were on a fixed and calm spot, we would already have seen my fishing hut.
CJ|0|180|14|0|In much less than a quarter of an hour we will be on dry land, for the wind is now very favorable to us.'
CJ|0|180|15|0|Cyrenius was satisfied with this answer, and Jonathan sailed through the bight with the speed of an arrow and reached the desired shore in a few minutes.
CJ|0|180|16|0|When the boat was made fast to the shore, all immediately stepped onto the land, and Cyrenius loudly thanked the God of Israel that He had saved him with all those dear to him.
CJ|0|180|17|0|When Jonathan heard that Cyrenius, whom he did not know at this time, praised the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, he said,
CJ|0|180|18|0|'My friend, now I am twice as glad that I have saved an Israelite in you, for I am also a son of Abraham!'
CJ|0|180|19|0|And Cyrenius responded, I am not quite that, for I am in fact a Roman - but I still know the holiness of your God and therefore acknowledge Him alone!'
CJ|0|180|20|0|And Jonathan said, That is still better! Tomorrow we will speak more about this, but for today go to rest.
CJ|0|180|21|0|See, my huts are roomy and clean. I also have straw in great quantity, so make yourselves a resting place - in the meantime I shall take my boat out again to see whether your ship cannot be refloated.'
CJ|0|180|22|0|Cyrenius naturally objected, 'Friend, tomorrow is time enough for that.'
CJ|0|180|23|0|But Jonathan answered, 'Tomorrow is the Sabbath, when we rest from all menial labor, so everything must be put in order still before sunrise.'
CJ|0|180|24|0|Thereupon Jonathan with his helpers again entered the boat and, since the wind had diminished somewhat, sailed all the more quickly out to the ship of Cyrenius. He had little trouble in refloating it, for the flood tide of the sea assisted by the full moon made matters all the easier.
CJ|0|180|25|0|Then Jonathan quickly seized the towing line, tied it to his boat, and with his helpers joyously rowed toward the fairly deep bight. Thus they brought the large ship into his safe harbor, where it was made fast to the shore by means of a very long rope, which was better for him than anchoring.
CJ|0|180|26|0|After this undertaking, which required a good two hours, Jonathan went home while the morning had already become fairly bright, laid down on his couch and with his helpers rested for three hours.
CJ|0|180|27|0|Cyrenius and his company also rested and slept fairly long into the morning.
CJ|0|180|28|0|When Jonathan awoke well refreshed, he honored and praised God in Joseph's Child and thought over what He had said to him.
CJ|0|180|29|0|Then he told the women to promptly butcher and roast about thirty of the choicest tuna for the many guests, and along with his helpers assisted the women.
CJ|0|180|30|0|In an hour the breakfast was prepared, and Jonathan went into the huts himself and awakened his rescued guests.
CJ|0|180|31|0|When Cyrenius awoke and found himself wholly refreshed and in good spirits, he immediately asked Jonathan whether he had been able to save the ship.
CJ|0|180|32|0|And Jonathan replied, 'Arise, and look out of this window!'
CJ|0|180|33|0|Cyrenius arose at once, looked outside, and beheld his great ship in the harbor quite well preserved.
CJ|0|180|34|0|At this he was glad beyond measure, went over to the giant rescuer and said in deep gratitude,
CJ|0|180|35|0|'Oh friend, such a deed cannot be rewarded in an ordinary manner - truly, I shall reward this deed in such a way as only an emperor can reward it!'
CJ|0|180|36|0|But Jonathan said, 'Friend, let that be for now, and come to breakfast with your company.'
CJ|0|180|37|0|Here Cyrenius asked in great surprise, 'What, you want to be our host also? Oh you noble man! Once I find out from you where I am, and who you are, then you shall also find out who I am, and a great reward shall by yours!'
CJ|0|180|38|0|Hereupon all arose from their resting places and followed Jonathan into the great hut where the breakfast already awaited the company, and all ate the well-prepared fish with great enjoyment and greatly praised Jonathan.
CJ|0|180|39|0|But Jonathan said 'Oh do not praise me, for the real credit for all that belongs to Someone Else - and not to me!
CJ|0|180|40|0|I was only a coarse instrument of Him who thus guided me and showed me in advance that I would have an important duty to perform during this past night.
CJ|0|180|41|0|And so it was - I found you in great danger and was your rescuer, and that was the will of the Most High.
CJ|0|180|42|0|I have fulfilled this holy will, and the realization that I have fulfilled the will of God out of love to Him is my great reward - and were you an emperor, you could not give me a greater!
CJ|0|180|43|0|Therefore I would also ask you to think of no other reward for me.
CJ|0|180|44|0|Just put your big and stately ship in order again, and when I learn the place of your destination from you, I shall also assist you in that matter with word and deed.'
CJ|0|180|45|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Friend, that you shall promptly find out!
CJ|0|180|46|0|See, my destination this time is Ostracine in Egypt, for I am the governor and a brother of the Emperor. My name is Cyrenius Quirinus.'
CJ|0|180|47|0|At these words Jonathan fell down on his knees and asked for grace in case he had offended in any way.
CJ|0|180|48|0|But just as Cyrenius wanted to raise up Jonathan, there came Joseph with his entire household to visit Jonathan because he was so long in keeping his promise of coming back to Joseph's house.
CJ|0|181|1|1|Cyrenius Comes To The Right Place
CJ|0|181|1|0|NOW JOSEPH did not go directly into the hut, but sent in a messenger and had him notify Jonathan that he was there.
CJ|0|181|2|0|Jonathan soon arose and said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|181|3|0|'Imperial, consular highness, I again ask your forgiveness if I have offended you in anything by my well-meaning rudeness!
CJ|0|181|4|0|For just as everything else is heavy about me, so also on occasion is my tongue!
CJ|0|181|5|0|But now I must go out again; for my neighbor and highly honored friend has called on me today.'
CJ|0|181|6|0|Cyrenius replied, 'Oh friend, my highly esteemed rescuer, do as you please and do not consider me, your debtor.
CJ|0|181|7|0|I am only going to put on some better clothes, whereupon I will promptly follow you myself!'
CJ|0|181|8|0|Jonathan now left Cyrenius and quickly went outside to receive Joseph.
CJ|0|181|9|0|Joseph in the meantime went nearer to where the ship was made fast so he could look at it more closely,
CJ|0|181|10|0|whereupon Jonathan hurried after Joseph and his company and soon caught up with them.
CJ|0|181|11|0|When the two had greeted each other and Jonathan had taken the little Child which had run to him upon his arms and caressed Him,
CJ|0|181|12|0|Joseph asked his big friend in great surprise,
CJ|0|181|13|0|'But brother, tell me - where did you get that ship?
CJ|0|181|14|0|Or did traveling guests arrive in it?
CJ|0|181|15|0|Truly, that is a magnificent ship, the likes of which one sees arrive only from Rome!'
CJ|0|181|16|0|And Jonathan replied, 'Oh friend, see, that is why I had to leave your villa even yesterday!
CJ|0|181|17|0|A heavy gale ran a Roman ship aground on a sandbank outside the bight yesterday.
CJ|0|181|18|0|My efforts - by the grace of this your little Child - succeeded in saving the ship from certain destruction.
CJ|0|181|19|0|The rescued, numbering about a hundred, are still in my living quarters which fortunately are roomy enough for them;
CJ|0|181|20|0|and I think that they will depart today, since the place of their destination is luckily our city itself, as they told me.
CJ|0|181|21|0|They still do not actually know where they are - for one must not tell the rescued that too soon -
CJ|0|181|22|0|but when they make their departure, I shall pilot them out anyhow!'
CJ|0|181|23|0|Joseph now asked Jonathan whether the rescued did not say who and whence they were.
CJ|0|181|24|0|At this Jonathan answered, 'You know that one must not tell tales out of school,
CJ|0|181|25|0|for as long as the rescued have not departed their names must not be revealed, since that could be injurious to them on a future journey.'
CJ|0|181|26|0|Here the little Child said U Jonathan, 'Oh man, you do indeed have a noble heart in which there is no guile,
CJ|0|181|27|0|but you are still richly endowed with many an old superstition!
CJ|0|181|28|0|Just the same it is better to be silent here than to speak - for the matter will clear itself up in a few moments, anyhow.'
CJ|0|181|29|0|When the little Child had said this, Cyrenius with his company stepped out the hut and went toward the ship, and thus straight toward the spot where Joseph was.
CJ|0|181|30|0|On the way over Cyrenius suddenly exclaimed to Tullia, 'Wife! Just look over there! Is not the group over there with our rescuer altogether like the one on whose account we journeyed to Ostracine?
CJ|0|181|31|0|By the living God! I have never seen anything like it! And look, our host right now has a little Child on his arms who wholly resembles the holy One that our heavenly friend has in Ostracine!'
CJ|0|181|32|0|Here the little Child wanted to be put down, and when He was free He at once ran toward the already closely approaching Cyrenius.
CJ|0|181|33|0|And Cyrenius stood still and gazed at the toward-him-running little Child very attentively.
CJ|0|181|34|0|And the little Child, when He was about three steps away from Cyrenius, called out,
CJ|0|181|35|0|'Cyrenius, Cyrenius, My dear Cyrenius, see how I hurry toward you - why do you not hurry toward Me also?'
CJ|0|181|36|0|Hereupon Cyrenius recognized the little Child, immediately fell on his knees along with Tullia and actually shouted,
CJ|0|181|37|0|'Oh my Lord, o my God! Who - just where am I, that You - my God - my Creator - my life - You who alone are all in all to me - come to meet me in this strange place?'
CJ|0|181|38|0|And the little Child answered, 'My dear Cyrenius, you are already in the right place - for where I am, there is surely the right place for you! See, there comes Joseph, and Mary, and Eudokia, My brothers and the eight children!'
CJ|0|181|39|0|Here Cyrenius declared, 'O my life, this is too much happiness for me at one time!' Thereupon he began to weep from happiness and could not speak for his too sacred feelings.
CJ|0|182|1|1|Storms Of The Soul - A Sign Of God's Love
CJ|0|182|1|0|JOSEPH NOW came over also and with Mary wept for joy because he was given to see his friend Cyrenius again after two years.
CJ|0|182|2|0|Here the little Child said to Cyrenius, 'Cyrenius, it is enough that you bow your heart before Me in all love -
CJ|0|182|3|0|but you may keep your knees straight! See, you have a large following with you which still does not know Me, and you shall not give Me away through such posture!
CJ|0|182|4|0|So arise from the ground and do as Joseph, Jonathan, Mary and all the others are doing - and have your wife arise also!'
CJ|0|182|5|0|Cyrenius now arose with Tullia, whereupon he promptly took the little Child on his arms and caressed Him.
CJ|0|182|6|0|With the little Child on his arm he stepped closer to Joseph and said,
CJ|0|182|7|0|'Greetings to you from the bottom of my heart! How many times indeed has my heart longed for you -
CJ|0|182|8|0|but the unfortunate matters of state have piled up so greatly during the past two years that I never knew how to win the time to follow this high and holy demand of my heart!
CJ|0|182|9|0|Only by now was I able to put everything so far in order that I could visit you, my divine friend, for a short time.
CJ|0|182|10|0|But even now that I followed the urge of my heart I would almost have perished if, without a doubt, this most holy little Child had not sent a rescuer to meet me!
CJ|0|182|11|0|'Oh my friend and brother, I have had much indeed to withstand during these last two years!
CJ|0|182|12|0|Persecution, betrayal, slander with the emperor and many other most unpleasant things did I have to endure!
CJ|0|182|13|0|But at such times I always thought of what the most holy little Child once said to me two years ago, namely, that He pinches and teases those He loves.
CJ|0|182|14|0|And truly, all these storms around my soul were nothing else than all sorts of caresses from this my Lord of all lords!
CJ|0|182|15|0|For wherever a wave rose up against me and threatened to devour me hide and hair,
CJ|0|182|16|0|there it was smashed by another still mightier counterwave, and nothing remained but only vain, empty shadows.
CJ|0|182|17|0|And now I am finally here totally unharmed after having withstood a great danger which threatened to swallow us all, and am in your to me truly divine company! Now all the storms which frightened me are becalmed as if they had gone to an eternal rest!'
CJ|0|182|18|0|Here Joseph embraced Cyrenius and replied, 'Yes, brother in the Lord, as you now have spoken, so it also is!
CJ|0|182|19|0|I did in fact always know within myself what was taking place with you - but I always praised the Lord thereat for loving you so much.
CJ|0|182|20|0|Now look over there toward noon and morning,42 and you will easily recognize the city and still more easily your own villa'.
CJ|0|182|21|0|So have your ship taken care of and come with me, and we will have a real heart-to-heart talk at home.'
CJ|0|182|22|0|When Cyrenius looked over and quickly recognized the villa, he was amazed and could not get over his surprise at all this.
CJ|0|183|1|1|The Mystery Of The Gale
CJ|0|183|1|0|ONLY WHEN CYRENIUS, in his great surprise, had looked in all directions and convinced himself of the correctness of all this, did he begin to speak more coherently and said to Joseph in a bewildered tone of voice,
CJ|0|183|2|0|'Yes, my truly noble friend and brother, it shall promptly be done as you wish!
CJ|0|183|3|0|But two things must first be made right.
CJ|0|183|4|0|In the first place my great rescuer must be rewarded - and that in a manner worthy of an emperor -
CJ|0|183|5|0|and secondly I must find out from you beforehand just how it was actually possible that I was driven off course to this place where I least expected to be.
CJ|0|183|6|0|'See, already beginning at Tyre, I constantly had a strong east wind which gradually changed into a regular gale!
CJ|0|183|7|0|I had already been driven about by this adverse wind for ten whole days on the high sea - God knows to where -
CJ|0|183|8|0|and when with the help of this great rescuer I finally had land beneath my feet again by last midnight I thought that I was in Spain, and close to the pillars of Hercules at that.
CJ|0|183|9|0|And now I am - instead of supposedly in Spain - exactly there, where I actually wanted to go!
CJ|0|183|10|0|Oh brother, oh friend, give me only a little enlightenment in this matter.'
CJ|0|183|11|0|And Joseph answered, 'Friend, first have your ship inspected by your crew to see if everything is in order -
CJ|0|183|12|0|then, with the grace of the Lord, I will tell you something about your sea voyage.'
CJ|0|183|13|0|Here Cyrenius responded to the wise Joseph, 'Oh friend, you seem very strange to me today.
CJ|0|183|14|0|Are you testing me? Or what is it that you have in mind with me?
CJ|0|183|15|0|Today is after all the Sabbath of your and my Lord, upon which you placed great importance wherever you were in the past.
CJ|0|183|16|0|And truly, I do not understand you and also do not know why you want to force a task upon me today.
CJ|0|183|17|0|See, This One here who rests on my arms holy, most holy, has surely put my ship in order long ago because I love Him above all!
CJ|0|183|18|0|What then will I accomplish by being anxious? I was in great danger and worried much -
CJ|0|183|19|0|but all my worry was vain - for only He and He alone rescued me!
CJ|0|183|20|0|Hence I shall not worry any more about anything in the future and shall certainly leave the ship alone today! Is it not right this way?'
CJ|0|183|21|0|And the little Child kissed Cyrenius and said, 'Joseph has only tested you in My name because you wanted to reward Jonathan before you went to the villa with him.
CJ|0|183|22|0|Now I say to you that you shall not reward Jonathan at all for I Am his reward Myself!
CJ|0|183|23|0|So just bestir yourself and go with Joseph, and everything will be made clear to you at home.' And Cyrenius immediately did what the little Child advised him to do, and all went to the villa.
CJ|0|184|1|1|The Way Of The Lord With Cyrenius
CJ|0|184|1|0|WHEN, with the exception of Jonathan's servants, the entire party had arrived at the villa, Joseph at once told his sons to prepare a good noon meal.
CJ|0|184|2|0|And Jonathan gave them the generous load of the most choice tuna fish which he had taken along for that purpose.
CJ|0|184|3|0|After this Joseph went with most of the members of Cyrenius' company and of course with Cyrenius himself, with Mary, with Jonathan and with the little Child, which Cyrenius still carried on his arms, up his favorite little hill.
CJ|0|184|4|0|And Eudokia and Tullia as well as the eight children did not remain in the house either, but also followed the company up the little hill which had a large, free space at the top.
CJ|0|184|5|0|Arrived there they all sat down on the benches made by Joseph and refreshed themselves beneath the fragrant shade of rose-, myrtle-and papyrus trees.
CJ|0|184|6|0|For the top of the hill was divided into two parts - one was thickly foliated and was meant for the daytime -
CJ|0|184|7|0|while the other was free and was meant for the evening and nightime, so one might enjoy the fresh air and the unrestricted view of the land as well as of the sky.
CJ|0|184|8|0|As they sat amid the beautiful, covered foliage of the hill, Cyrenius asked Joseph whether he would not give him the desired enlightenment now concerning his sea voyage.
CJ|0|184|9|0|And Joseph answered, 'Yes, brother, here is the place and the time for that, so hear me!
CJ|0|184|10|0|See, the east wind signifies the grace of God! This drove you stormily to Him whom you now hold on your arms!
CJ|0|184|11|0|Now there still are ever so many who do not know and recognize the Lord's grace nor when and how it operates.
CJ|0|184|12|0|Thus you also did not know what the Lord's boundless grace intended for you.
CJ|0|184|13|0|'You thought yourself lost and supposed that the Lord had wholly forgotten you!
CJ|0|184|14|0|And behold, when you were stranded on the sand bar by the boundless grace of the Lord and gave yourself up for lost, the Lord seized you with great power and rescued you from every downfall!
CJ|0|184|15|0|For thus has always been and will always be the way of the Lord, by which He leads those who have been and will be on the road that leads to Him!
CJ|0|184|16|0|'Now why did the Lord lead you thus? - See, as it became known about Tyre that you would go here by ship, paid assassins assembled,
CJ|0|184|17|0|took vessels and wanted to murderously assault you on the high seas!
CJ|0|184|18|0|At this the Lord suddenly sent a strong east wind -
CJ|0|184|19|0|which very quickly pushed your ship away from your enemies, so they were wholly unable to reach it.
CJ|0|184|20|0|But since your enemies did not let you out of their sight but constantly followed you all the more fiercely, the Lord's grace over you then turned into a gale.
CJ|0|184|21|0|This gale drowned your enemies in the sea and put your ship at rest in the right place where you were fully rescued. - Cyrenius, now do you understand this, your sea voyage?'
CJ|0|185|1|1|A Gospel On Prayer Pleasing To God
CJ|0|185|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS had heard this from Joseph, he turned to the little Child resting on his arms and said to Him,
CJ|0|185|2|0|'O You whose Name my tongue will never be worthy to express! Then that was nothing but grace from You, my Lord and God?
CJ|0|185|3|0|How, in what way shall I now thank You, how praise and honor You for such immeasurable, truly wonderful grace?
CJ|0|185|4|0|What can I, a poor, dull human being really do for You in return, o Lord, since You are so immeasurably merciful to me and protect me more than Your own heart?'
CJ|0|185|5|0|Here the little Child said, "My beloved Cyrenius! You would be much more pleasing to Me if only you would not always heave such sighs before Me!
CJ|0|185|6|0|What after all do I and you get out of it when you sigh thus before Me?
CJ|0|185|7|0|I say to you, rather be of good cheer and love Me as well as all other people in your heart, and you will please Me more than if you always sigh for no reason in the world.'
CJ|0|185|8|0|Cyrenius now inquired most tenderly of the little Child,
CJ|0|185|9|0|'O my life, my all! May I then not pray to You, my Lord and my God?'
CJ|0|185|10|0|And the little Child answered, 'Oh yes, you may indeed do that - but not with all manner of never-ending exclamations,
CJ|0|185|11|0|but only in your spirit, which is your love towards Me, and in its truth, which is the true light that streams forth from the flame of love!
CJ|0|185|12|0|Do you really suppose that I become more opulent, mightier and greater by the prayers of men than I already am without such prayers?
CJ|0|185|13|0|'Oh see, that is just why I have appeared out of My eternal infinity in this body, so that men should pray to Me more with their love -
CJ|0|185|14|0|and should therewith spare their mouth, their tongue and their lips! For that kind of prayer degrades the worshiper as well as the worshiped, because it is dead nonsense, a characteristic of the heathen!
CJ|0|185|15|0|What after all do you do with your good friends and brothers when you gather with them?
CJ|0|185|16|0|See, you are delighted to see them, greet them and offer them hands, breast and head.
CJ|0|185|17|0|Do the same with Me also, and I shall eternally ask nothing else of you!
CJ|0|185|18|0|And now be wholly of good spirits, look around a bit after your children and inquire of them a little as to what they have already learned,
CJ|0|185|19|0|and you will have greater joy thereat and will also prepare Me a greater joy than if you were to sigh and exclaim a hundred times on end!'
CJ|0|185|20|0|At this Cyrenius became very glad and promptly called the eight children over to himself and asked them about various things.
CJ|0|185|21|0|And the children gave him such thoroughly informed answers to every question that he could not get over his surprise thereat.
CJ|0|185|22|0|Cyrenius was very happy indeed at this - and the children were also happy that they were so smart, and Cyrenius made generous presents to them all and praised the schoolmaster.
CJ|0|186|1|1|Cyrenius Receives A Rare Gift
CJ|0|186|1|0|THEREUPON the oldest of the three boys went over to Cyrenius and inquired,
CJ|0|186|2|0|'Father Quirinus Cyrenius! Since you have now examined us about various things and we did not fail you in any answer and you were pleased with all of us on that account -
CJ|0|186|3|0|would you not, for your love and concern, also accept a present in return from me?'
CJ|0|186|4|0|Cyrenius smiled at this question and said to the boy,
CJ|0|186|5|0|'Your offer, my dear Sixtus, is very pleasing and welcome to me, only you must describe the object which you wish to give me more closely,
CJ|0|186|6|0|and I shall then tell all of you right away whether or not I can accept it!'
CJ|0|186|7|0|Here the boy answered, 'Oh father Quirinus Cyrenius, it is no object which we want and are able to give you as a present,
CJ|0|186|8|0|but a new science, or which you have surely had no idea until now!'
CJ|0|186|9|0|When Cyrenius heard this from his Sixtus, he said to him,
CJ|0|186|10|0|'Listen, my dear Sixtus, if that is the way the matter stands, then you can make me a present of as much as you ever care to, and I shall most willingly accept it all!'
CJ|0|186|11|0|After this declaration of Cyrenius the boy said,
CJ|0|186|12|0|'Well then, if that pleases you, oh father Quirinus Cyrenius, then listen to me!
CJ|0|186|13|0|You have surely never heard up to now what our earth looks like, and what form it has.
CJ|0|186|14|0|What form do you suppose that it has, the great earth, which carries us all and nourishes us through the grace of God in her?'
CJ|0|186|15|0|Cyrenius was taken aback by this question and did not know what he should say thereto.
CJ|0|186|16|0|Only after a while did he answer the boy, 'Listen, my boy, your question puts me in a great quandary; for I cannot give you a definite answer thereto.
CJ|0|186|17|0|We do of course have a great many conjectures concerning the nature of the earth; but as far as the definite truth is concerned, one cannot answer only with conjectures.
CJ|0|186|18|0|Therefore you go ahead and speak alone, and I shall hear you and then form an opinion of your presentation.'
CJ|0|186|19|0|Here the boy, at a wink from Joseph, ran into the house and very carefully brought the same earth-globe which the little Child had created from an orange the night before because of the eclipse of the moon.
CJ|0|186|20|0|When Cyrenius saw this object, he was surprised and asked, 'Well, just what is that? Is that perhaps the supposed present itself?
CJ|0|186|21|0|After all, you said a little while ago that the present did not consist in an object, but only in a scientific exposition!
CJ|0|186|22|0|But that is nevertheless an object and no scientific exposition.'
CJ|0|186|23|0|The boy replied, 'Dear father Quirinus Cyrenius, that is no doubt true, but I cannot make you a present of this object because it is not mine;
CJ|0|186|24|0|but it is necessary here if you are to understand me.'
CJ|0|186|25|0|Here the boy, with the aid of the earth-globe, began to explain the character of the earth like a professor, and that with such thoroughness that Cyrenius was deeply astonished thereat.
CJ|0|186|26|0|And when the boy had finished, the little Child said to Cyrenius, 'That is right! And so you may have a memento thereof, this little earth shall also be yours, until you will someday receive a greater one in My kingdom!'
CJ|0|187|1|1|Be Not Concerned About Your Brother
CJ|0|187|1|0|CYRENIUS WAS so extraordinarily pleased at this present that he just could not help himself for all his happiness.
CJ|0|187|2|0|After a while, when he had thoroughly looked over the splendid globe in all directions and convinced himself of the truly significant portrayal of all the points known to him, he declared,
CJ|0|187|3|0|'Joseph, that is indeed a more than loud witness for all of us about Him who once created the earth!
CJ|0|187|4|0|For what is indeed more difficult to the Almighty: to create a great earth, or to create one as small as this for our instruction about the great one which carries us?
CJ|0|187|5|0|I would say that is no doubt one and the same thing!
CJ|0|187|6|0|'O God, o great God, what infinite fullness of all manner of perfect things must dwell in You that such wondrous things are so very easily possible to you!
CJ|0|187|7|0|Whoever concerns himself with You in his heart is already blessed in the world!
CJ|0|187|8|0|Whoever possesses You and lovingly carries You in his heart, he can be considered fortunate beyond measure!
CJ|0|187|9|0|Oh how disgusting do the vain pursuits of the children of the world seem to me now!
CJ|0|187|10|0|Oh my poor brother Augustus! If you knew and understood what I now know and understand, how greatly your tottering throne would disgust you!
CJ|0|187|11|0|O my little Jesus, my life, my all! Would You not show my brother through Your omnipotence how insignificant and incredibly shabby his throne is?'
CJ|0|187|12|0|And the little Child said, 'Cyrenius, look at all the creatures of the earth,
CJ|0|187|13|0|and you will find good and bad ones among them in regard to you.
CJ|0|187|14|0|Do you really suppose that they are also like that in regard to Me?
CJ|0|187|15|0|See, the lion is a cruel animal and spares no life in his fury.
CJ|0|187|16|0|Did you also find this animal like that where I am concerned?
CJ|0|187|17|0|Not in the least, you say in your heart, for this king of the desert twice saved my life!
CJ|0|187|18|0|'See, thus matters also stand with your brother - he cannot be like you, nor you like him.
CJ|0|187|19|0|That is why I have called all sorts of creatures into being, because they are a necessary part of My eternal order as they are.
CJ|0|187|20|0|Thus it also had to happen that your brother became what he is, and you also became what you are.
CJ|0|187|21|0|And when your brother says: Lord, I do not know what I am and what I do, but Your power is with me, and I act according to its purpose;
CJ|0|187|22|0|then your brother is as right as you are, and you shall not be concerned about him - for at some future time everyone's works will become manifest!' - These words put Cyrenius into a better frame of mind about Augustus, and he again looked at his little earth.
CJ|0|188|1|1|A Test Of Love For Cyrenius
CJ|0|188|1|0|WHILE CYRENIUS was looking at his earth-globe again with great attentiveness, the little Child wanted to be put down so He might frisk back and forth a bit on the hill.
CJ|0|188|2|0|At this Cyrenius set Him on the ground ever so gently and avowed,
CJ|0|188|3|0|'O my life, my salvation, my all! Only from my hands do I free you bodily -
CJ|0|188|4|0|but never, never from my heart: for there you dwell from now on quite alone - yes, You all alone are my love!
CJ|0|188|5|0|Truly, as long as I have only You, my Savior, then the whole world with all its treasures means less than nothing to me!'
CJ|0|188|6|0|Here the little Child turned to Cyrenius again and said,
CJ|0|188|7|0|'I will just have to remain with you after all - although I really would like to frisk around a bit - because you love Me so much!
CJ|0|188|8|0|If you had constantly gazed at your little earth, see I would have become a bit bored with you:
CJ|0|188|9|0|but since you have directed your heart as well as your whole attention to Me again, I just have to remain with you and cannot separate Myself from you!
CJ|0|188|10|0|Now listen, My dear Cyrenius, just what will your wife say to that, since she has surely heard that you love only Me and no one else?'
CJ|0|188|11|0|And Cyrenius asserted, 'Lord, if I just have You, what do I care about my wife and the whole world? See, all that I am ready to trade off for a mite!
CJ|0|188|12|0|O my Jesus, what can possibly give greater happiness than to love You above all things and to be loved in return by You?
CJ|0|188|13|0|Therefore I would rather despise Tullia like a horde of locusts than to depart from my love to You by only a hair's breadth!'
CJ|0|188|14|0|The little Child now asked, 'Cyrenius, if I tested you a bit in that matter, do you really think that you would remain constant?'
CJ|0|188|15|0|And Cyrenius declared, 'The way I now feel, You could turn the whole world to dust beneath my feet and take Tullia from me a thousand times, if it were possible, and I still would remain constant in my love toward You!'
CJ|0|188|16|0|Hereupon Tullia, as if smitten by a stroke, suddenly sank to the ground and was dead.
CJ|0|188|17|0|This was a great shock to the whole company, and fresh lemon juice and water were quickly brought to revive her;
CJ|0|188|18|0|but all effort was vain - for Tullia was stone dead.
CJ|0|188|19|0|And when Cyrenius saw that Tullia was really dead, he covered up his face and was very sad.
CJ|0|188|20|0|Thereat the little Child asked the sorrowing Cyrenius, 'Cyrenius what am I to make of you now? See, the earth is still whole, and your wife is far from being killed a thousand times as you requested - and you sorrow as if you had lost everything in the world!
CJ|0|188|21|0|Do you not still have Me just as before when I meant everything to you? How then can you be so very sad?'
CJ|0|188|22|0|Hereupon Cyrenius sighed deeply and said very plaintively, 'O Lord, I just did not know how dear Tullia was to me as long as I had her - and only her loss showed me her worth!
CJ|0|188|23|0|Therefore I am sad and will indeed sorrow for her, who was such a noble and faithful helpmate to me, for the rest of my life!'
CJ|0|188|24|0|At this the little Child also sighed deeply and said, 'Oh you changeable children of men, how little constancy dwells in your hearts!
CJ|0|188|25|0|If men are already like this in My presence, what will they be like when I am not among them any more?
CJ|0|188|26|0|Cyrenius, what was I to you a few minutes ago, and what am I to you now?
CJ|0|188|27|0|You cover your face before Me as before the world, and your heart is so filled with sorrow that you can hardly hear My voice.
CJ|0|188|28|0|'Now I tell you: Truly, like that you are far from being worthy of me!
CJ|0|188|29|0|For whoever still loves his wife more than Me, he is not worthy of Me, since I am after all more than woman, created by My power!
CJ|0|188|30|0|I say to you: Take better counsel with yourself in the future, or you will never see My face in this world!'
CJ|0|188|31|0|Thereupon the little Child went over to Joseph and told him, 'Joseph, have the deceased one brought into the little side room and have her lain on a bier.'
CJ|0|188|32|0|Here Joseph inquired, 'My little Son, will she never come back to life?'
CJ|0|188|33|0|And the little Child said, 'Do not ask Me about that - for My time is still a long way off, but do instead as I told you!
CJ|0|188|34|0|See, the woman was jealous of Me when Cyrenius confessed his love to Me - it was this jealousy and this love-envy which killed her so quickly. So do not ask Me further and have her brought into the little side room and lain on a bier, for she is really dead!'
CJ|0|188|35|0|At this Joseph promptly had the corpse brought into the house and lain on a bier set up in a small side room.
CJ|0|188|36|0|All now went over to Cyrenius and comforted him at this sudden loss of his wife.
CJ|0|188|37|0|But Cyrenius soon uncovered his face, straightened up like a real hero and said,
CJ|0|188|38|0|'Oh dear friends, do not comfort me in vain - for I have already found my consolation in my own heart
CJ|0|188|39|0|and you could not possibly give me a better one!
CJ|0|188|40|0|See, the Lord gave me this noble wife in a truly wonderful way, and now He has taken her from me again - for He alone is truly the Lord of all life!
CJ|0|188|41|0|Let everything therefore be offered up to Him and His holy name be praised and honored for it always.
CJ|0|188|42|0|'It is indeed a hard blow to my weak human heart - but now I also perceive it to be all the more enlivening for my spirit!
CJ|0|188|43|0|For by means of this the Lord has freed me and I am not unencumbered by any earthly bonds and belong to Him alone, and He alone is now the holy dweller in my heart! So do not comfort me - for He alone is my consolation forever.'
CJ|0|188|44|0|And the little Child went to Cyrenius and said to him, 'Amen! So be it forever!
CJ|0|188|45|0|Like a breath these years on earth in which we will still work here will pass away - and then you will be where I shall be forever among those who will love Me like you do. So be it forever, and ever, and ever!'
CJ|0|189|1|1|Cyrenius Builds A New, Living Temple
CJ|0|189|1|0|THF SONS OF JOSEPH now came and announced that the meal was prepared.
CJ|0|189|2|0|Hereupon Joseph went over and told this to Cyrenius, who was giving his whole attention to the little Child again, and asked him whether he was able to take any food because of his sorrow.
CJ|0|189|3|0|And Cyrenius said, 'Oh my noble brother, do you really think that I am in the least hungry?
CJ|0|189|4|0|Just look here! How can one possibly become hungry in the company of Him through whom myriads and myriads are filled at every moment?
CJ|0|189|5|0|Now as concerns the sadness you suppose me to have, I there say out of the fullness of my love to Him who created you and me:
CJ|0|189|6|0|How could I possibly mourn in the company of your Lord and mine?
CJ|0|189|7|0|See, where you sow one kernel of wheat into the ground wherein it decays, He has a hundred come up in place of the one!
CJ|0|189|8|0|'Now that is also the case here: Where the Lord takes one. He soon gives a thousand for it!
CJ|0|189|9|0|He has indeed taken the jealous Tullia from me, but He has given Himself to me in her place.
CJ|0|189|10|0|Oh brother, what an infinite replacement that is for such a small loss!
CJ|0|189|11|0|Instead of my wife I can now call Him eternally my own in my heart."
CJ|0|189|12|0|Here Joseph stated, 'Brother, you have become great before the Lord! Truly, you were a pagan - and now are better than many Israelites!
CJ|0|189|13|0|Yes, I must confess it before you: your heart and your mouth put me greatly to shame -
CJ|0|189|14|0|for I have still to experience such submission to the Lord's will in myself.'
CJ|0|189|15|0|At this the little Child sat up and said, 'Joseph, I know why I chose you - but you were never greater before Me than even now, when you confess your weakness before a pagan.
CJ|0|189|16|0|Now I tell you, since you already gave Cyrenius the witness that he is better than many Israelites:
CJ|0|189|17|0|'Cyrenius is more here than Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and more than Moses and the prophets, and more than David and Solomon!
CJ|0|189|18|0|For their deeds were just because of their faith and great piety in their hearts-
CJ|0|189|19|0|but Cyrenius is a first-fruit whom My love has awakened, and that is more than the entire old covenant which was dead, while Cyrenius is wholly alive!
CJ|0|189|20|0|You know the magnificence of the temple in Jerusalem, which is a product of Solomon's wisdom.
CJ|0|189|21|0|But that temple is dead like its designer, who sacrificed Me for the women.
CJ|0|189|22|0|And Cyrenius has now built Me a new, living temple in his heart by his great self-denial. There I shall live eternally, and that is more than all the wisdom of Solomon.'
CJ|0|189|23|0|At this Cyrenius began to weep for happiness, and Joseph as well as Mary deeply engraved these words in their hearts - for they were full of power and full of life.
CJ|0|190|1|1|The Lord Over Death And Above The Sabbath
CJ|0|190|1|0|THE LITTLE CHILD then said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|190|2|0|'Cyrenius, now you are indeed filled in your heart, and this stilling of your hunger will last you eternally-
CJ|0|190|3|0|but your body is hungry, and you need sustenance there for the same purpose that I also need earthly sustenance for My body.
CJ|0|190|4|0|So come down with Me into the house, where we will eat a good fish which Jonathan brought with him today and which My brothers have prepared very well.
CJ|0|190|5|0|For I must tell you that I much prefer to eat fish to that monotonous Jewish children's mush, and I am really looking forward to a good little portion.
CJ|0|190|6|0|Oh, I tell you, My dearest Cyrenius, I very much enjoy eating the fish and am therefore also very fond of Jonathan because he is a pure fisherman and often brings us the best fish!
CJ|0|190|7|0|Oh I tell you, My very dear Cyrenius, after the meal you must play with Me a bit, and your children also.
CJ|0|190|8|0|You are still young, so you can run and jump around with Me a little.'
CJ|0|190|9|0|This purely childish talk of the little Child pleased Cyrenius so greatly that he quite forgot the dead Tullia, although his companions mourned her,
CJ|0|190|10|0|and a few of the company also began to be concerned about Cyrenius because of his gaiety which seemed to be a form of madness to them.
CJ|0|190|11|0|Maronius himself went over to Cyrenius and asked him how he felt.
CJ|0|190|12|0|Here the little Child promptly answered in place of Cyrenius, saying,
CJ|0|190|13|0|'Oh Maronius, do not be concerned for My friend here, for he was never freer from madness in his whole life than now!
CJ|0|190|14|0|I wish you were as sound as Cyrenius, for then you surely would not put such a question in My presence.
CJ|0|190|15|0|Do you also come down with us to the table - perhaps a good piece of fish will heal you.'
CJ|0|190|16|0|Cyrenius now went into the house with the little Child, with Joseph, Mary, Jonathan, Eudokia and with the eight children, and Maronius followed them, although somewhat as if treading on thorns;
CJ|0|190|17|0|but the rest of the great company mourned and did not go to the noon meal.
CJ|0|190|18|0|After the meal, which all those present found very tasty, the little Child promptly wanted to go out into the open again and play with the eight children.
CJ|0|190|19|0|But Mary said, 'Now listen, my Jesus! You really may not play now, and neither may the eight children - for in the first place it is now the Sabbath, and in the second place we have a corpse in the house, and there one must not play, but should be especially quiet and subdued.'
CJ|0|190|20|0|And the little Child retorted, 'Woman, what sort of spirit tells you to speak to Me like that?
CJ|0|190|21|0|Is the Sabbath more than I - and the dead woman more than My will?
CJ|0|190|22|0|But so you may see that I stand above the Sabbath and above the dead woman, and that she does not hinder Me in My joy, let her awaken!'
CJ|0|190|23|0|At these words the corpse arose from the bier and soon thereafter came into the room.
CJ|0|190|24|0|The little Child now told them to give her something to eat, and then promptly went out into the open with Cyrenius, while all were greatly surprised at this awakening.
CJ|0|191|1|1|Cyrenius Wins A Race With The Child
CJ|0|191|1|0|WHEN THE LITTLE CHILD was out in the open with Cyrenius and the other eight children, He said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|191|2|0|'See that tree over there - how far do you suppose it is from here?'
CJ|0|191|3|0|'I would say,' replied Cyrenius, 'that it should, by good measure, be about two hundred paces from here.'
CJ|0|191|4|0|And the little Child said, 'Then let us race there and see which of us has the fastest feet!'
CJ|0|191|5|0|Here Cyrenius smiled and observed, 'O Lord, with Your earthly strength You will no doubt be the last one to reach the tree!'
CJ|0|191|6|0|But the little Child said, 'Only the result will show that, so let us make the attempt!'
CJ|0|191|7|0|At this the racers ran with all their might, and the little Child was at the tree first.
CJ|0|191|8|0|Upon arriving at the tree, Cyrenius, almost out of breath, asserted,
CJ|0|191|9|0|'O Lord, I just knew that You would not run naturally and thus would reach the goal first!
CJ|0|191|10|0|For you are carried by unseen powers, but I am carried only by my sluggish feet!'
CJ|0|191|11|0|Here the little Child stated, 'Cyrenius, herein you have once more gone astray - for your feet are animated by unseen powers as well as Mine!
CJ|0|191|12|0|But the difference consists in that I am a Master, but you are only a student of the powers.
CJ|0|191|13|0|And when you really learn to exercise your powers, you will also be able to use them like the Master does!
CJ|0|191|14|0|Now let us run back, and we will see who will reach the place in front of the house first this time.'
CJ|0|191|15|0|Here Cyrenius quickly bent down to the earth, lifted up the little Child and ran back with Him - and was by far the first one at the goal.
CJ|0|191|16|0|Arrived there, the little Child smiled and said, 'That was great fun!
CJ|0|191|17|0|See, you have achieved mastery at once - you saw the Master, took Him up and therewith became a master yourself.
CJ|0|191|18|0|Now mark the lesson therein: In the future no one will become a master by his own efforts anymore,
CJ|0|191|19|0|but if he takes up the Master, he then will become a master through the Master whom he has taken up.
CJ|0|191|20|0|'It matters little who is able to run the fastest - but for all that everyone should strive to reach the goal set by Me ahead of any other goal and ahead of anyone else!
CJ|0|191|21|0|Whoever will undertake the path of life on his own power, he will be the last -
CJ|0|191|22|0|but whoever will do as you just did during the second race, he will also find himself to be the first at the goal just like you!
CJ|0|191|23|0|Now let us change over to another pastime and have some fun in a childlike way.'
CJ|0|192|1|1|A Prophetic Game Of The Future Begins
CJ|0|192|1|0|THE LITTLE CHILD NOW turned to Sixtus as the oldest boy among the children adopted by Cyrenius, and said to him,
CJ|0|192|2|0|'Sixtus, go and make ten little pits there at the edge of the path, each a hand-span away from the other. You already know what to do.
CJ|0|192|3|0|Then bring the ten little marbles that James made from clay for us to play with, and we shall toss a few marbles - you already know how, since you are the one who showed Me!'
CJ|0|192|4|0|At this Sixtus promptly did what the little Child wanted.
CJ|0|192|5|0|When the ten little pits were made, and the clay marbles were brought, the little Child said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|192|6|0|'Now set Me down again so I can explain to you and show how this game goes, but you other children must not interrupt Me, since I want to explain the matter to Cyrenius Myself.'
CJ|0|192|7|0|Hereupon the little Child with pathos turned to Cyrenius and declared,
CJ|0|192|8|0|'See, the game goes as follows: you must stand three paces away from this little pit, then toss a marble.
CJ|0|192|9|0|If you make a successful toss into the tenth and therewith last and farthest pit you are the king of the game; if you reach the ninth, you then are a prime minister; in the eighth you are a general!
CJ|0|192|10|0|In the seventh you are a governor, in the sixth a judge, in the fifth a priest, in the fourth a farmer, in the third a father, in the second a mother and in the first a child!
CJ|0|192|11|0|How the game then goes on I shall tell you as soon as the pits are occupied.'
CJ|0|192|12|0|Hereupon Cyrenius smilingly took a marble and tossed it along the path, and the marble quickly rolled into the first pit!
CJ|0|192|13|0|And the little Child asked, 'Are you satisfied with your station? Otherwise you can as a beginner toss twice more!'
CJ|0|192|14|0|And Cyrenius said, 'O all joy of my life, my Jesus! I am satisfied just where I am!'
CJ|0|192|15|0|and the little Child replied, 'Good, so do all of you now toss, one after the other. I shall make the last toss!'
CJ|0|192|16|0|And the children tossed their marbles but did not occupy all the little pits but generally came together in twos and threes in one pit.
CJ|0|192|17|0|Finally the little Child tossed and came, as always, into the tenth pit.
CJ|0|192|18|0|At this a girl complained and declared, 'So the little Jesus just has to be a King all the time!'
CJ|0|192|19|0|But the little Child retorted, 'Why are you vexed at that? You after all tossed ahead of Me, so why are you so awkward with your hand?
CJ|0|192|20|0|Now do not be cross with Me over that, or I shall quickly send you another mouse of which you are so much afraid!'
CJ|0|192|21|0|To this the girl said no more and was reconciled to being alone in her second pit.
CJ|0|192|22|0|And since the ninth, eighth, seventh and sixth pits were unoccupied, Cyrenius said to the little Child,
CJ|0|192|23|0|'See, O my life! We still have no prime minister, no general, no governor and no judge!
CJ|0|192|24|0|Who now will take over these important posts?'
CJ|0|192|25|0|'These posts', replied the little Child, 'I will now have to look after Myself, since no one occupied them, for all the unoccupied posts must be taken over by one, starting with the one who occupies the Kingâs pit!
CJ|0|192|26|0|If the pit of the prime minister were occupied, the three following posts would go to him. But since this post is vacant, the four pits fall only to the King! - And since all the pits are now occupied, let us begin the actual game!'
CJ|0|193|1|1|The Symbolic Children's Game
CJ|0|193|1|0|AND the little Child continued, 'Now that I am the King, everyone must also obey Me as everyone obeys a king!
CJ|0|193|2|0|And so then hear My laws! Let the pit of the priests be wise and mostly kind (rather than strict)!
CJ|0|193|3|0|Whoever laughs is relieved of his office and falls into disgrace.
CJ|0|193|4|0|Little pit of the farmer, be active, for when you are indifferent you will have to hunger.
CJ|0|193|5|0|Little pit of the father, be full of love toward your children and raise them correctly and justly, or you will be ridiculed by them.
CJ|0|193|6|0|Little pit of the mother, be frugal and filled with fear of God, so your infants will become wise.
CJ|0|193|7|0|And My dear little children's pit, remain as you are: a constant teacher of the wise toward wisdom in God!
CJ|0|193|8|0|Now these are the laws and they must be followed precisely.
CJ|0|193|9|0|But if anyone wants a favor from Me, he must come to Me for it kneeling!
CJ|0|193|10|0|Go now and be active, and leave Me alone. And you, Cyrenius, must go with the father and the mother because you are a child.'
CJ|0|193|11|0|A girl and a boy who took the part of priests now went to a somewhat elevated spot in a dignified and serious manner.
CJ|0|193|12|0|Then two girls and a boy went their way as farmers and busied themselves quite actively on the ground as if their work were the most important.
CJ|0|193|13|0|Next another boy and a girl, conducting themselves quite gravely, went their way and represented the father who, to be a proper father, should also be a mother in his heart.
CJ|0|193|14|0|Then the one mother went to her place followed by her child, Cyrenius. But the mother was too shy of her child and did not dare to speak to him and teach him wisely.
CJ|0|193|15|0|She therefore turned back to the King and asked Him for the grace of giving her another office.
CJ|0|193|16|0|The King then referred her to the priests who began to laugh when they saw the mother coming their way.
CJ|0|193|17|0|At this the King immediately called the priests over and deposed them because they had laughed when they should have been wise and dignified, and made farmers of them.
CJ|0|193|18|0|But the farmers soon began to argue and quarrel among themselves, and the King called them and smoothed over their differences and established peace among them.
CJ|0|193|19|0|Now the mother came again and wanted another office.
CJ|0|193|20|0|Here the King said, 'Since you represent love in its wisdom, then be the priest!'
CJ|0|193|21|0|Then the father came and complained that he had no wife, because the mother was a priest.
CJ|0|193|22|0|And the King replied, 'Then take the child and go over and take the place of the mother.'
CJ|0|193|23|0|And so it was done - but the priest now began to demand of the farmers that they should become more subservient to him.
CJ|0|193|24|0|At this matters soon fell into great disorder, and the King recalled them all and said, I see that you are all at odds - so let us make a new toss.'
CJ|0|194|1|1|The First Woman's Nature Is Rebuked
CJ|0|194|1|0|CYRENIUS AGAIN tossed his marble first, and this time landed in the ninth little pit, and the children of Cyrenius declared,
CJ|0|194|2|0|'Father Cyrenius, that is really moving up: from child to prime minister, and that at the first toss!
CJ|0|194|3|0|If you were to toss again, you surely could get into the King's pit.'
CJ|0|194|4|0|But Cyrenius said, 'My children, I am already satisfied with this honor - so you just go ahead and toss the marbles.
CJ|0|194|5|0|See to it that you get into the children's pit quite often, for there you will find the best and most desirable place.'
CJ|0|194|6|0|Thereupon Sixtus quickly tossed, landed in the children's pit and was quite happy.
CJ|0|194|7|0|Then the oldest girl tossed and again landed in the second mother's pit.
CJ|0|194|8|0|At this the girl complained as she had done before, saying, 'Oh, so I have to be the mother again after all!'
CJ|0|194|9|0|Here the little Child went over, took the marble out of the pit, handed it back to the girl and said,
CJ|0|194|10|0|'Here, toss again, you dissatisfied one - but see to it that you do not toss into the mother's pit again!'
CJ|0|194|11|0|The girl now tossed once more, landed in the same pit, and nearly wept from vexation.
CJ|0|194|12|0|At this the little Child again stepped over to her and asserted, 'Oh you tyrannical creature! Truly, in you the first woman's nature is revealed!
CJ|0|194|13|0|What shall I do with you, oh serpent's nature, oh lion's paw?
CJ|0|194|14|0|I shall promptly call a mouse that will really torment you, then you will no doubt become more to My liking.'
CJ|0|194|15|0|At this the girl quickly fell on her knees before the little Child and implored amid tears,
CJ|0|194|16|0|'My dearest Jesus, I beg You, just no mouse or rat - for that makes me terribly afraid!
CJ|0|194|17|0|Truly I will a thousand times rather take the part of the mother than to see a single mouse!'
CJ|0|194|18|0|Here the little Child said, 'This time I shall spare you with a mouse -
CJ|0|194|19|0|but if you grumble once more, then ten mice will come at you at once and sniff at your feet!'
CJ|0|194|20|0|At this the girl was quiet as a mouse and watched quite patiently while the other children occupied all the other pits,
CJ|0|194|21|0|and did not even take exception when another girl occupied the father's pit, which otherwise always vexed her the most if a boy did not occupy it.
CJ|0|194|22|0|Lastly the girl tossed and still once more landed in the mother's pit.
CJ|0|194|23|0|At this she bit her lips in secret vexation.
CJ|0|194|24|0|And the little Child smiled, took a little twig, dabbed all the marbles with it and then breathed over the little pits, and instantly a lively mouse sat therein in place of the marble.
CJ|0|194|25|0|When the girl beheld these little animals she began to scream and to talk incoherently in great excitement, and ran away.
CJ|0|194|26|0|Here Joseph came outside and asked, 'My dear Jesus, what is the matter between You and the girl again, that she screams so loudly?'
CJ|0|194|27|0|The little Child replied, 'She is jealous, as always, so I have visited her again with a few mice!'
CJ|0|194|28|0|At this Joseph smiled and went after the girl to calm her, while the rest of the children peacefully continued with their game, for they saw nothing of the terrible mice.
CJ|0|195|1|1|A Simile Of The World's Children
CJ|0|195|1|0|AFTER A WHILE the girl returned, and the little Child promptly asked her if she wanted to join in the game again.
CJ|0|195|2|0|But the girl replied, 'I do want to look on, but I do not want to play, for I am easily annoyed and then You are promptly severe!
CJ|0|195|3|0|So I do not want to take part, for I am too greatly afraid of You because You quickly call forth rats and mice.'
CJ|0|195|4|0|Here the little Child said, 'Well, why then are you so foolish and become annoyed about matters by which you have nothing to lose whether they turn out one way or the other?
CJ|0|195|5|0|Be satisfied with what your lot brings you, and no rats or mice will bother you any more!
CJ|0|195|6|0|Look at Me! I always toss last, and I do not grumble when, in fact, the precedence rightfully belongs to Me.
CJ|0|195|7|0|Why then do you grumble when you as a girl should really personify patience itself?'
CJ|0|195|8|0|The girl replied, 'How can I help that? Why then do I have such a disposition? I have not given it to myself, so I am as I am and cannot be otherwise!
CJ|0|195|9|0|And since I know that I am like that, I would rather not join in the game, for if anything annoys me You will punish me again with mice.'
CJ|0|195|10|0|At this the little Child turned away and remarked as if to Himself, 'See, the children of the world remonstrate with You and criticize Your work among themselves because they do not know You!
CJ|0|195|11|0|But one more throw and still another throw, and the children of the world will think differently of You!'
CJ|0|195|12|0|Thereupon the little Child turned around and asked the girl, 'Whom then do you blame, that you are thus angry and are now dissatisfied with your lot?'
CJ|0|195|13|0|Here the girl retorted,'Truly, when You, my dear Jesus, once start asking, then there is no end to it,
CJ|0|195|14|0|and You then become a terribly annoying Child because of that!
CJ|0|195|15|0|What do I know about who is responsible that I am like this? You Yourself are a sort of little prophet and are a wonder Child that can speak with God!
CJ|0|195|16|0|Ask Him, if You can, and He will best be able to tell You why I am like this!'
CJ|0|195|17|0|At this the little Child stepped closer to the girl and asserted, 'Girl, if you knew Me, you would speak otherwise.
CJ|0|195|18|0|But since you do not know Me, you allow your tongue to run away with you!
CJ|0|195|19|0|Just look up there to the sun! What do you suppose it is, and from whom does it get its lustre?'
CJ|0|195|20|0|But the girl, who had already become quite impatient, complained, 'Why do you have to pick especially on me and downright torment me with your questions?
CJ|0|195|21|0|Just look, there are seven others, but You do not ask them anything! Go over to them for a while and bother them with Your eternal questioning!'
CJ|0|195|22|0|And the little Child retorted, 'Oh girl, see, they are well and need no medicine - but you are sick in your soul, wherefore I would indeed help you if you were not so contrary!
CJ|0|195|23|0|But since you are so very contrary, it will be difficult to help you.
CJ|0|195|24|0|But just remember this: if an angel from the heavens of God were given the grace to be questioned by Me like you are, he would become so inflamed in his great bliss that the fire of his love would destroy the whole earth in an instant!
CJ|0|195|25|0|Now leave Me - for I do not care for you any more because you are so contrary and stubborn!' - Here the girl left and secretly wept, while Jesus as King continued to direct His playmates.
CJ|0|196|1|1|A New King Over All The World
CJ|0|196|1|0|IN THE COURSE of this second game still other dissensions arose among the players.
CJ|0|196|2|0|The prime minister was too greatly feared because Cyrenius held that office, so the general as well as the governor and the judge hardly dared to undertake anything against the prime minister and. privately sulked at such an arrangement.
CJ|0|196|3|0|Especially the two girls, who held the offices of prefect and judge, were not satisfied because they were not permitted to do anything without the permission of the prime minister.
CJ|0|196|4|0|Only Sixtus in his children's pit was wholly satisfied.
CJ|0|196|5|0|The little Child saw this discord, hence He called them all together again, handed out the marbles once more and had them toss for the third time.
CJ|0|196|6|0|At this toss Cyrenius landed in the king's pit and the little Child in the children's pit;
CJ|0|196|7|0|and all the children were highly pleased that for once the two years and four months old Jesus also landed in the children's pit.
CJ|0|196|8|0|Here even that certain girl returned and said to the little Child, 'See, that is the proper place for You! It makes me happy that for once You also landed in this boring little pit!'
CJ|0|196|9|0|The little Child replied, 'See, the prime minister's pit is still free. Take a marble and toss - perhaps you will land in it!'
CJ|0|196|10|0|Thereupon the girl took the marble again, tossed and actually landed in the prime minister's pit.
CJ|0|196|11|0|And when she saw herself in the pit of the prime minister, she turned quite red for joy that her ambition had finally been satisfied, and jokingly remarked,
CJ|0|196|12|0|'Well, my Jesus, look out; now I shall surely punish You if You are disobedient!'
CJ|0|196|13|0|Here the little Child said, 'You know, the children are free from the law - how will you treat Me and what will you do to Me'?'
CJ|0|196|14|0|And the girl replied, 'Just let the game begin, and You shall promptly see whether the prime minister has no power over the children!'
CJ|0|196|15|0|Then Cyrenius as king allotted the game, and all went to their places and there administered their office.
CJ|0|196|16|0|But the prime minister especially incited the priest against the Child, that he should not in any case give Him a hearing.
CJ|0|196|17|0|Thus all the other offices also had no ear for the Child.
CJ|0|196|18|0|And the Child therefore ran to the king and complained to him according to the rule of the game over His persecution.
CJ|0|196|19|0|But the king answered, 'O Lord, I am still not familiar enough with these rules!
CJ|0|196|20|0|But since, notwithstanding these rules, a disorder has again crept into the game, I will recall the little company once more, and if You wish, we can make a new toss right away.'
CJ|0|196|21|0|And the little Child declared, 'Yes, Cyrenius, a new one and forever the last one!
CJ|0|196|22|0|So then call the children together that we may make the final throw!'
CJ|0|196|23|0|Cyrenius now called the children together, distributed the marbles, and all tossed.
CJ|0|196|24|0|This time all the children as well as Cyrenius tossed into the children's pit - only Jesus tossed into the king's pit.
CJ|0|196|25|0|At this His pit at once began to glow, and His marble began to shine like the sun.
CJ|0|196|26|0|And the little Child took the shining marble, laid it into the father's pit and then asked Cyrenius,
CJ|0|196|27|0|'Cyrenius, now do you understand something of this significant game?'
CJ|0|196|28|0|Cyrenius answered, 'O Lord, my life, how should I be able to understand that?'
CJ|0|196|29|0|And the little Child replied, 'Then listen to Me - I shall interpret it for all of you plainly and thoroughly.'
CJ|0|197|1|1|The Little Child Interprets The Game
CJ|0|197|1|0|AND THE LITTLE CHILD immediately began to speak like a wise teacher in a synagogue, and said,
CJ|0|197|2|0|'Now this is the meaning of this game: From the beginning of creation, as well as before it, God was the Lord from eternity.
CJ|0|197|3|0|The first toss signifies: The ancients recognize the freedom of their spirit but do not want to give the glory to God, and the game gets out of order.
CJ|0|197|4|0|This game lasts from Adam to Noah and from Noah to Moses.
CJ|0|197|5|0|The contrary girl represents love to God as well as to the world which rejects love.
CJ|0|197|6|0|In Noah's day mankind is judged by what amounts to a threat, as this girl was chastised with mice.
CJ|0|197|7|0|But mankind does not improve and gradually falls into idolatry and wants altars, a visible deity and much ceremony.
CJ|0|197|8|0|'Here the Lord calls for an end to the game during the leadership of Moses, and a second throw takes place.
CJ|0|197|9|0|In the beginning it seems as if this time it would endure: but just as soon as Moses turns his back, the golden calf is fashioned!
CJ|0|197|10|0|Thus the girl begins to quarrel all the more, for which she is earnestly rebuked with the threat of actual judgment.
CJ|0|197|11|0|Hence the flood was actually more of a very strong threat than an actual judgment.
CJ|0|197|12|0|But the judgment of the people in the desert was an actual judgment, since it was done by fire as once at Sodom.
CJ|0|197|13|0|With that throw, the new game begins. At first matters go well, but only out of fear; for this game is lacking in love, represented by the mother, who withdrew because she was not permitted to rule.
CJ|0|197|14|0|This Mosaic game lasted until this time and destroyed itself by all manner of revolts and through constant fear.
CJ|0|197|15|0|'Again the Lord calls the little flock together; the toss is made, and the Lord becomes a Child.
CJ|0|197|16|0|Here love comes and expresses a certain joy at the impotent state of the Lord.
CJ|0|197|17|0|Love now tosses also, and succeeds in attaining to the first step of the throne.
CJ|0|197|18|0|And there she persecutes the Lord unto death and leaves Him no rest for over one thousand and about nine hundred years and incites everything against Him.
CJ|0|197|19|0|By that time the established powers themselves realize that this state of affairs cannot endure.
CJ|0|197|20|0|'And a final throw is made: The Lord again becomes the only Lord as of old - His rule is filled with burning zeal, and His throw is marked by the fullness of His grace!
CJ|0|197|21|0|And all the people will recognize the Father from the children's place when He as Such approaches closer and closer to the people with all the power of His love!
CJ|0|197|22|0|And that will be the final throw, and no other will take place evermore! For then the Father will be the Father eternally!
CJ|0|197|23|0|See, that is the interpretation of this game. Now let us go back into the house to see what the reawakened Tullia is doing, so follow Me, all of you.'
CJ|0|198|1|1|A Parable Of The Future
CJ|0|198|1|0|WHEN THE GROUP OP PLAYERS came into the house, they were hardly noticed, for everyone was still occupied with the reawakened Tullia.
CJ|0|198|2|0|A few consoled her, while others busied themselves about her and were concerned lest she have another relapse and die.
CJ|0|198|3|0|Mary and Eudokia also waited on her and brought her a number of morsels and refreshments,
CJ|0|198|4|0|while the sons of Joseph, including James, were busy preparing the evening meal.
CJ|0|198|5|0|Only Joseph and Jonathan sat in the side room on a straw bench and discussed various things out of the past,
CJ|0|198|6|0|and they were also the only ones who noticed those that entered, then arose, went toward Cyrenius and the little Child and received them in the most cordial manner.
CJ|0|198|7|0|Hereupon the little Child went right over to Joseph and inquired of him,
CJ|0|198|8|0|'How much longer will the fools still comfort and restore the reawakened Tullia?
CJ|0|198|9|0|She has been quite normal for some time and will not die again before her appointed time; what are the fools trying to do?'
CJ|0|198|10|0|Joseph replied, 'What do we care? Let them have their pleasure, for we are not losing anything by it!'
CJ|0|198|11|0|And the little Child retorted, 'That is obviously true, and I will not pay much attention to it -
CJ|0|198|12|0|but I would say that this is also true: if the awakened Tullia already deserves so much admiration, the Awakener should not be forgotten either!'
CJ|0|198|13|0|Joseph said, 'You are right, my little Son; but what are we to do?
CJ|0|198|14|0|If I declare You to be the unfailing Awakener, that would be betraying You before Your time to those who are still far from knowing You!
CJ|0|198|15|0|And if You wondrously breathed such recognition into their soul, they would then come under judgment!
CJ|0|198|16|0|So let us leave them as they are, and we shall secretly harmonize with each other here in spirit and in truth.
CJ|0|198|17|0|For when they have gaped their fill and consoled the Romaness to the limit, then they will no doubt come over and join us."
CJ|0|198|18|0|And the little Child said, 'Here is still another picture of the future.
CJ|0|198|19|0|For those who profess to be of our faith will consort with the dead Romaness because of the things of this world,
CJ|0|198|20|0|and much will be made of Mary among the Romans and by the Romaness.
CJ|0|198|21|0|Just the same, those who claim our faith will not be our followers, but rather what they are now, namely pagans, and will not honor Me, but only Mary!
CJ|0|198|22|0|And My true followers will remain small and inconspicuous in the world at all times!
CJ|0|198|23|0|Tullia was a blind beggar woman and received her sight through My living water
CJ|0|198|24|0|and then became a first lady in the great empire of the pagans.
CJ|0|198|25|0|But because she became jealous she also met her death.
CJ|0|198|26|0|She was awakened once more that she might live - she lives, but up to now she has not noticed Me.
CJ|0|198|27|0|Will I then have to draw her attention to Me by a judgment?
CJ|0|198|28|0|I will wait a little while longer and see whether the Romaness will not arise and come to Me, her Awakener! - Joseph, do you understand this parable?'
CJ|0|199|1|1|The Universal Significance Of The Lord's Descent
CJ|0|199|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH HEARD THIS from the little Child, he said,
CJ|0|199|2|0|'O my little Son of God, I have indeed understood You in my heart,
CJ|0|199|3|0|but I must confess that you did not make me a pleasant prediction there!
CJ|0|199|4|0|For if the greatest part of mankind will remain pagans and worshipers of idols after You as they did before You, for what purpose then is this Your descent to earth?
CJ|0|199|5|0|For what purpose is such degradation of Your infinite, eternal Holiness? Do you want to help only a few? Why not all?'
CJ|0|199|6|0|Here the little Child answered, 'Oh Joseph, you really ask a lot of vain questions.
CJ|0|199|7|0|Have you never looked at the starry heavens? See, each star which you behold is a world, is an earth upon which free human beings live as they do here!
CJ|0|199|8|0|And there are countless numbers which no mortal eye has seen, and behold, this My descent to earth is meant for them all!
CJ|0|199|9|0|But the how and why you will only be given to see in My kingdom in greatest clarity.
CJ|0|199|10|0|So do not be surprised that I have made such a prediction to you concerning the inhabitants of this world -
CJ|0|199|11|0|for I have inhabited worlds without end and number, and all these innumerable and endless hosts have need of this My descent
CJ|0|199|12|0|and have need of it because My own eternal order needs it, from which this earth as well as all others without number and end have gone forth.
CJ|0|199|13|0|'For matters will indeed come to pass on the earth as I have foretold you.
CJ|0|199|14|0|But for all that the eternally holy purpose of this My descent will not be in vain!
CJ|0|199|15|0|See, all these countless worlds, suns and earths have their courses, and these likewise have directions in infinite numbers.
CJ|0|199|16|0|Everywhere there are other laws and everywhere another order;
CJ|0|199|17|0|but ultimately they all still harmonize in My one, fundamental order and correspond to the one grand central purpose as do the limbs of the body and their functions.
CJ|0|199|18|0|'And behold, thus it ultimately will also be with the children of the earth, and at some future time when they are in the spirit they will all recognize that there is only one God, one Lord, one Father and only one perfect life in Him!
CJ|0|199|19|0|But how and when? - That remains with Him who now told you about it.
CJ|0|199|20|0|For many winds must first blow over the surface of the earth
CJ|0|199|21|0|and much water fall down from heaven and a great quantity of wood burned before it can be said:
CJ|0|199|22|0|Behold, now there is one flock and one Shepherd, one God and only one Man from innumerable hosts, one Father and one Son in and from the numberless hosts!'
CJ|0|199|23|0|These words of the little Child made the hairs of Cyrenius, Jonathan as well as Joseph stand on end, and Joseph protested,
CJ|0|199|24|0|'O little Child, Your words are becoming more and more incomprehensible, amazing and truly terrible!
CJ|0|199|25|0|Who can grasp their infinite depth? Therefore speak with us according to our understanding, otherwise we perish at such depth of your speech!'
CJ|0|199|26|0|Here the little Child smiled and replied, 'See, Joseph, today I am in an especially communicative mood to reveal things to you at which you should all shudder.
CJ|0|199|27|0|And you shall all fully realize therefrom that the perfect Lord of eternity is in fact at home in Me and now lives among you! - And so hear Me out!'
CJ|0|200|1|1|The Child Foretells The Crucifixion And Resurrection
CJ|0|200|1|0|AND THE LITTLE CHILD continued, 'Joseph, what will you say if the children of the world will one day seize and kill the Lord with the help of Satan?
CJ|0|200|2|0|When they will seize Him like one seizes a murderous robber and will drag Him before the tribunal of the world, where the spirit of hell has its sway?
CJ|0|200|3|0|And this tribunal will have the Lord of all glory fastened to the cross - what do you say to that?
CJ|0|200|4|0|When it will be done with Him as the prophets, whose words are well known to you, have foretold of Him - what do you say to that?'
CJ|0|200|5|0|When the three heard this from the little Child they were filled with a great fear, and Joseph exclaimed vehemently,
CJ|0|200|6|0|'My Jesus, my little Son of God, truly, may that never happen to You of all people!
CJ|0|200|7|0|The hand which would ever violate You shall be cursed forever and its bearer's soul shall do penance for its outrage eternally in the greatest possible torment!'
CJ|0|200|8|0|And Cyrenius, along with Jonathan, also joined with Joseph and declared,
CJ|0|200|9|0|'Yes, if such could possibly ever happen - of an eternal truth I will, beginning today, become the most cruel tyrant!
CJ|0|200|10|0|Twice one hundred thousand of the most practiced warriors are under my command - only one nod is required of me, and death and destruction shall be brought to all the world!
CJ|0|200|11|0|Before an impudent devil of a man shall lay his satanic hands on this Child, I will rather have all the people on the whole earth done away with!'
CJ|0|200|12|0|Here the little Child smiled and said, 'Then your warriors will still remain, and who will dispose of these?
CJ|0|200|13|0|See, My dear Cyrenius, whoever knows what he is doing and does wrong, he commits sin and is a doer of evil -
CJ|0|200|14|0|but whoever does not know what he is doing, and then does wrong, it shall be forgiven him! For he did not really know what he was doing.
CJ|0|200|15|0|Only if someone well knew what he was doing and would do no wrong of himself, but nevertheless does not resist when he is forced and then does wrong, he is a slave of hell and pulls a judgment down on his own head.
CJ|0|200|16|0|'For hell well knows that it is easier to deal with blind instruments than with those that see -
CJ|0|200|17|0|for which reason it constantly keeps these blind slaves in her pay, and these very blind slaves are the ones who will fasten the Lord of glory to a cross!
CJ|0|200|18|0|And how will you punish a blind man because he struck his foot against something on the road and fell and broke his arms and legs?
CJ|0|200|19|0|So just take good care to stay right at home with your power, which would sow much more harm than good on the earth!
CJ|0|200|20|0|And be assured that He, whom men will kill according to the flesh in their blindness, will not be killed in spirit and in His power, but will quickly arise again out of His own strength and power
CJ|0|200|21|0|and in this way alone open the way to eternal life for all creatures!'
CJ|0|200|22|0|In the meantime, the vehement tone of Cyrenius had drawn the group around Tullia over to the little group in the side room.
CJ|0|200|23|0|But the little Child sent them back and said, 'Go about your business; for what goes on here is not for you who are blind!' - And the group thereupon withdrew.
CJ|0|201|1|1|A Prediction For The Followers Of Jesus
CJ|0|201|1|0|MARY, EUDOKIA AND JAMES were also among those who were told to leave.
CJ|0|201|2|0|But Mary nevertheless went in, and Eudokia and James followed her.
CJ|0|201|3|0|And Mary bent down to the little Child and said,
CJ|0|201|4|0|'Listen, my little Son! You are really being terribly strict!
CJ|0|201|5|0|If You already turn me away from the door now, what will You do with me when You become a man?
CJ|0|201|6|0|See, You must not be that strict with her who carried You under her heart with great fear and much suffering!'
CJ|0|201|7|0|Hereupon the little Child looked at Mary in an indeed loving but also earnest way and asked,
CJ|0|201|8|0|'How is it that you call Me your little Son? Do you not recall what the angel said to you?
CJ|0|201|9|0|How shall you call That which was born of you?
CJ|0|201|10|0|See, the angel said: And What will be born of you will be called God's Son, the Son of the Most High!
CJ|0|201|11|0|Since it certainly was that way and not otherwise, how then do you call Me your little Son?
CJ|0|201|12|0|If I were your Son, you would concern yourself more with Me than with Tullia!
CJ|0|201|13|0|But since I am not your Son, it follows that Tullia is closer to your heart than I!
CJ|0|201|14|0|If I play around outside somewhere and then come back in through the door, not a soul meets Me with a flaming heart,
CJ|0|201|15|0|and I am just like the daily bread for the hired men and maid-servants, and no one spreads out his arms to Me.
CJ|0|201|16|0|But when some gossip comes here from town, she is immediately received with all honors!
CJ|0|201|17|0|And so it is now with the foolish Tullia who received her life from Me - you practically crawl to her with all the attention you give her!
CJ|0|201|18|0|'Me, the Giver of life, you hardly notice!
CJ|0|201|19|0|Now tell Me, is that right?
CJ|0|201|20|0|Am I not more than some stupid city gossip and not more than Tullia?
CJ|0|201|21|0|Oh rejoice all of you who will one day be My followers and servants! For as it now happens to Me, so will it also happen to you!
CJ|0|201|22|0|Your patrons put you in a corner with the garbage when they are visited by their gossip-brothers and gossip-sisters!' - These words went deep into Mary's heart, and thereafter she paid close attention to them.
CJ|0|202|1|1|Worldliness, The Enemy Of The Inward Life
CJ|0|202|1|0|FOLLOWING THESE WORDS James also bent down to the little Child and inquired of Him,
CJ|0|202|2|0|'Listen, my beloved Jesus, my tender little Brother! Once You become critical, it is almost impossible to put up with You!
CJ|0|202|3|0|Would You not like to give me such a reprimand as You just gave mother Mary?
CJ|0|202|4|0|You undoubtedly can do it - but then I shall also sulk against You because You did not invite me to the game, since I would have taken part in it with all my heart.'
CJ|0|202|5|0|Here the little Child said, 'Oh do not be concerned, James, that I shall say anything to you -
CJ|0|202|6|0|for your constant attentiveness to Me is well know to Me.
CJ|0|202|7|0|Besides, we quite often share the same fate, and there you are no better off than I am.
CJ|0|202|8|0|See, when you oftentimes go out with Me and then carry Me home again, sometimes all the way from the city when you have something to do there and then take Me with you,
CJ|0|202|9|0|no one comes to meet us! We leave without any other company, and when we come home again, not a soul comes to receive us -
CJ|0|202|10|0|as we went forth alone, so also do we come back alone.
CJ|0|202|11|0|And if we now and then come a quarter of an hour too late, we get a good dressing down also.
CJ|0|202|12|0|And when we are at home, we may not even stir if we do not want to be scuffed.
CJ|0|202|13|0|And as much as is sometimes talked about all manner of things, say whether we are also counted among the interesting things which might be considered worthy of mention with a few words during the day.
CJ|0|202|14|0|'But when some acquaintance from the city sends word and says: I shall visit you on Monday,
CJ|0|202|15|0|our house already looks forward to it three days in advance and talks about it afterwards for another three days.
CJ|0|202|16|0|And when the friend comes, everything runs to meet him, and when he leaves, he is accompanied to the door of his house.
CJ|0|202|17|0|But when we come and go, not a cat in the house stirs.
CJ|0|202|18|0|Instead the word is, when such a nimble-tongued city gossip comes here: James, you had better go outside now with the little Child,
CJ|0|202|19|0|and then we promptly go outside by ourselves and may not come back until it has pleased the gossip to depart, accompanied by the entire house.
CJ|0|202|20|0|Only when Cyrenius or Jonathan comes do we also count a little, if important considerations do not hinder it.
CJ|0|202|21|0|So do not worry that I shall say something to you which could hurt you - for we both are truly treated the same as concerns esteem and love!
CJ|0|202|22|0|If we do not stir during the whole day nor open our mouths, then we are well-behaved! And this well-behaved is in fact our whole reward. Are you satisfied with that? I am not!'
CJ|0|202|23|0|When Joseph and Mary heard this, they were both afraid. But the little Child put them at ease and admonished, 'Just a little improvement in the future. The past is over and done with!' - And James wept from great joy in His heart.
CJ|0|203|1|1|The Difference Between A Mask And Prudence
CJ|0|203|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH called the little Child over to himself and said to Him,
CJ|0|203|2|0|'I would like to be heard now! But what I have to say I do not say because of You, but because of those who are here.
CJ|0|203|3|0|For I know that You always discern my most secret thoughts, so I do not need to say anything to You; but I will say it to You so those who are here may know what is in my heart.
CJ|0|203|4|0|Now it is true that we were often as if indifferent toward You outwardly -
CJ|0|203|5|0|but this indifference was only a mask of our inward love and respect for You, so You would not become known to the cruel world.
CJ|0|203|6|0|Who indeed knows the world better than You? Therefore no one but You will better realize that our up-to-now outward conduct toward You had to be thus so we could feel certain that we would not betray You.
CJ|0|203|7|0|Therefore I ask You to forgive us in those instances when our hearts seemed to be cold, but which nonetheless always glowed like the rosy dawn when we beheld You.
CJ|0|203|8|0|And be assured that in the future we will also conduct ourselves toward You before others as our inward urge will tell us to do.'
CJ|0|203|9|0|After thus being spoken to, the little Child replied: 'Joseph, you have spoken truly - but there still is a great difference between a mask and prudence.
CJ|0|203|10|0|A mask makes the heart cold - but prudence warms it.
CJ|0|203|11|0|Why then a mask, when prudence is sufficient? Why a pretense, when one's natural wisdom offers a thousand protective measures?
CJ|0|203|12|0|'Am I not the Lord whom the whole endless creation must obey at a nod because it is nothing other than a thought firmly held in My mind and exists as a spoken word from My mouth?
CJ|0|203|13|0|And since I am the sole and only true Lord, how then should the masking of your heart be more effective toward My protection from the world than a whole world filled with My eternal power?
CJ|0|203|14|0|Behold, one breath from My mouth - and the entire visible creation ceases to exist!
CJ|0|203|15|0|'Do you then suppose I have need of a mask over your feelings to protect Myself and you from the persecutions of the world?
CJ|0|203|16|0|Oh no, of that I have no need! For I do not keep Myself hidden from the world because I fear it,
CJ|0|203|17|0|but only to avoid a judgment which would befall the world if it recognized Me in its iniquity.
CJ|0|203|18|0|Hence all of you should indeed be prudent in the future so you will not bring a judgment on the world -
CJ|0|203|19|0|but do not approach Me with a mask, which even in its best form is an offspring of hell.
CJ|0|203|20|0|And you, Mary, return to your first love, or you will have much sorrow to endure someday because you now treat Me coldly by masking your heart for the sake of the world!'
CJ|0|203|21|0|This word broke Mary's heart, and she seized the little Child with all the power of her love and pressed Him to her heart and caressed Him with the greatest ardor of her motherly love.
CJ|0|204|1|1|The Parable Of The Wise King
CJ|0|204|1|0|WHEN MARY HAD CARESSED the little Child for a while, she asked Him quite fearfully,
CJ|0|204|2|0|'My Jesus, will You really love me, Your handmaiden, as much in return as Your handmaiden will eternally love You?'
CJ|0|204|3|0|And the little Child smiled at Mary in a most friendly way and answered,
CJ|0|204|4|0|'Now that was indeed a frail human question!
CJ|0|204|5|0|If I did not love you more than you love Me, verily, verily, what would you be?
CJ|0|204|6|0|'Behold, if you loved Me with the fire of all the suns, your love would still be nothing against that love of Mine with which I love even the most wicked human being in My anger.
CJ|0|204|7|0|And My anger is in itself more love than your greatest love.
CJ|0|204|8|0|What all the more then is My actual love which I have for you?
CJ|0|204|9|0|How indeed would I ever have chosen you as the one to give Me birth if I had not loved you - more than eternity will ever comprehend?
CJ|0|204|10|0|See, how humanly frail your question is! - Now I say to you: Go and bring Tullia -
CJ|0|204|11|0|for I have some very important matters to discuss with her.'
CJ|0|204|12|0|Here Mary quickly obeyed and brought the wife of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|204|13|0|When Tullia quite fearfully stepped into the side chamber where the little Child sat up and addressed Tullia as follows,
CJ|0|204|14|0|'Tullia, whom I have recalled to life, listen! Once there was a great king who was single and full of manly grace and filled with divine wisdom.
CJ|0|204|15|0|This king said to himself: I will go and seek me a wife in a strange land where no one knows me-
CJ|0|204|16|0|for I want to take a wife for my own sake, and the woman shall love me because I am a wise man, but not because I am a great king!
CJ|0|204|17|0|'Thereupon he departed from his kingdom into a faraway, strange land and came into a city where he soon became acquainted with a house.
CJ|0|204|18|0|The daughter of the house was chosen and she was filled with joy, for she soon recognized the great wisdom of her suitor.
CJ|0|204|19|0|'And the king thought: Now you do indeed love me because you see me, and my form and my wisdom captivate you -
CJ|0|204|20|0|but I want to see whether you really love me! Therefore I shall disguise myself as a beggar and bother you thus from time to time.
CJ|0|204|21|0|But you shall not know nor have reason to suspect that I am incognito in the beggar.
CJ|0|204|22|0|The beggar, to be sure, shall carry a token of me as if he were my intimate friend, but otherwise poor in this alien land like his friend.
CJ|0|204|23|0|And it then shall become manifest whether this daughter really loves me! -
CJ|0|204|24|0|'And as the great king had thought the matter through, so also did he promptly carry it out.
CJ|0|204|25|0|After a while, since the king had seemingly gone on a journey, the beggar came to the daughter and said to her:
CJ|0|204|26|0|Dear daughter of this wealthy house, see, I am very poor and know that you possess great riches!
CJ|0|204|27|0|I sat at the gate as your glorious betrothed went on a journey, and asked him for a charity.
CJ|0|204|28|0|Thereat he stopped and said: Friend, I have nothing here that I could give you except this keepsake from my betrothed who is very rich.
CJ|0|204|29|0|Go to her soon and show this to her in my name, and she will give you what you have need of as surely as she would give it to me.
CJ|0|204|30|0|And when I shall speedily return, I shall make everything good to her a thousand-fold!
CJ|0|204|31|0|'When the daughter heard this, she was full of joy and imparted to the beggar.
CJ|0|204|32|0|Thereat the beggar left and returned in a few days and had himself announced to the daughter.
CJ|0|204|33|0|The daughter sent him word to call another time, since she now had company.
CJ|0|204|34|0|The beggar came another time and had himself announced.
CJ|0|204|35|0|There it was said: The daughter has gone out with a few friends. And the beggar sadly turned back.
CJ|0|204|36|0|'As he, while leaving, came to the house door, he was encountered by the daughter in the midst of her friends, but she hardly paid any attention to him.
CJ|0|204|37|0|The beggar of course inquired: Dear betrothed of my friend, how can you love him when you do not hear his friend?
CJ|0|204|38|0|But the daughter replied: I want amusement - when your friend returns, I shall no doubt love him again.
CJ|0|204|39|0|'Thereupon the beggar again went to the daughter the following day and found her full of gayety; for she had a very lively company.
CJ|0|204|40|0|And the beggar asked her: Do you really love your betrothed - and are so gay, since he is away in matters concerning you?
CJ|0|204|41|0|At this the daughter conveyed the beggar outside and retorted: That is asking too much! Is it not enough if I love him when he is here? Why should I also love him in his absence? Who knows whether he loves me?
CJ|0|204|42|0|'Here the beggar tore his outer garment, threw it from him and declared to the astonished daughter:
CJ|0|204|43|0|See, he who was on a journey was always here to observe your love!
CJ|0|204|44|0|But you hardly thought of him, and he who showed you the token of your oath was rejected and ridiculed, since the company of the world suited you better.
CJ|0|204|45|0|And behold, the same is none other than he who now stands before you, and is that great king to whom all the world belongs!
CJ|0|204|46|0|And the same now gives back to you a thousand-fold what you gave him - but to you he turns his back forever and you shall never see his face!
CJ|0|204|47|0|'Tullia! Do you know this King and this Beggar? See, it is I, and you are the daughter! In the world you shall be happy -
CJ|0|204|48|0|but this parable tells you what will be afterwards.
CJ|0|204|49|0|I gave you life and great happiness, and you are capable of forgetting Me?
CJ|0|204|50|0|Oh you blind-born Romaness! I gave you light, and you did not recognize Me.
CJ|0|204|51|0|I gave you a husband from the heavens, and you wanted to take that part of his love which belonged to Me for yourself.
CJ|0|204|52|0|'Thereat you died - I have reawakened you, for which you accepted the homage of the world and paid no attention to Me.
CJ|0|204|53|0|And now that I had you called, you quake before Me like an adulteress.
CJ|0|204|54|0|Tell Me, just what shall I do with you?
CJ|0|204|55|0|Shall I continue to beg before your door?
CJ|0|204|56|0|No, that I shall not do, but I shall give you your portion, and then we shall be quits!' -
CJ|0|204|57|0|These words filled the entire house of Joseph with dread.
CJ|0|204|58|0|Hereupon the little Child requested to go out into the open with no one but His James and did not return until late in the evening.
CJ|0|205|1|1|The Repentant Tullia Is Forgiven
CJ|0|205|1|0|ONLY AFTER a while did Tullia recover from the shock which these words had given her, whereupon she began to weep bitterly and said,
CJ|0|205|2|0|'O Lord, why did I one day receive sight in this house; why did I become the wife of Cyrenius, so I now in my supposed good fortune must suffer so much?
CJ|0|205|3|0|Why did You awaken her who was dead? Why did life again have to return into my breast?
CJ|0|205|4|0|Was I then born for torment and why must I be the one, while thousands live peacefully and happily and hardly know anything about the tear which anguish presses from the eye?'
CJ|0|205|5|0|Hereupon Mary, stirred by compassion, consoled Tullia with the following words:
CJ|0|205|6|0|'Tullia, you must not contend with the Lord, your and my God!
CJ|0|205|7|0|You see, it has ever been the way of the Lord that He subjects the very ones whom He loves to quite strong trials!
CJ|0|205|8|0|Recognize this in your heart and awaken your love to Him anew, and He will quickly forget His threat and will receive you anew into His grace!
CJ|0|205|9|0|For quite often indeed has He threatened the doers of evil and has had their destruction declared to them for the following day by the prophets and designated the spot, where the dogs should lick up their blood.
CJ|0|205|10|0|But if the evil-doer repented, He promptly spoke to the prophet: Do you not see that he does penance? Therefore I will not punish him either.
CJ|0|205|11|0|'When Jonah was called of God to declare destruction to the Ninevites, who had become enmeshed in all manner of sins
CJ|0|205|12|0|he did not want to go there, for he said: Lord, I know that only very seldom do You let follow what the prophet must threaten;
CJ|0|205|13|0|hence I do not want to go there, so I as a prophet will not come to shame before the Ninevites when You will surely have compassion with them again!
CJ|0|205|14|0|See, even this prophet placed a well-founded doubt on the anger of God!
CJ|0|205|15|0|Now I would advise you: Do what the Ninevites did, and you will again be received into grace!'
CJ|0|205|16|0|These words gave Tullia new courage, and she began to examine herself and soon found a great many faults within herself and admitted,
CJ|0|205|17|0|'Oh Mary, only now do I realize and it becomes clear to me why the Lord does thus chastise me!
CJ|0|205|18|0|See, my heart is full of sins and full of impurity. Oh, how will I ever be able to cleanse it again?
CJ|0|205|19|0|How then can I dare to love the holy One of all holiness with a most impure heart?'
CJ|0|205|20|0|And Mary replied, 'That is just why you must love Him in the repentant acknowledgement of your guilt, for only such love alone will cleanse your heart before Him, the holy One of all that is holy.'
CJ|0|205|21|0|When, late in the evening, the little Child entered the house again with His James, He at once went to Mary and requested something to eat, and Mary promptly gave Him some bread, butter and honey.
CJ|0|205|22|0|Thereupon He said, I now see another food - give Me to eat of that too! See, it is Tullia's heart; give it to Me, since you have already prepared it for Me!' - Here Tullia fell down before the Lord and wept.
CJ|0|205|23|0|At this Mary said, 'O Lord, have mercy on the poor one, who suffers much!'
CJ|0|205|24|0|And the little Child stated, i have long ago had mercy with her, or I would never have awakened her!
CJ|0|205|25|0|Only it was she who would not take any notice of My mercy and would rather contend with Me in her heart than to receive Me into it.
CJ|0|205|26|0|But since she has now turned her heart to Me, I have done to her as to the Ninevites.'
CJ|0|205|27|0|After these words the little Child went over to Tullia and said to her,
CJ|0|205|28|0|'Tullia, see, I have now become very tired; once you carried Me upon your arms and it did Me good - for you have very soft arms.
CJ|0|205|29|0|Therefore arise this time also and take Me upon your arms, and feel how sweet it is to have the Lord of life upon your arms!'
CJ|0|205|30|0|This request of the little Child fully broke Tullia's heart.
CJ|0|205|31|0|With her heart's greatest possible love she took the little Child on her soft arms and, while weeping, asked,
CJ|0|205|32|0|'O Lord, how is it possible that You are now so gracious to Me after Your terrible threat?'
CJ|0|205|33|0|And the little Child answered, 'Because you put the old Tullia, who was repugnant to Me, away from you and put on a new one, esteemed by Me! But be quiet now - for I do indeed love you again.' - And all those present were stirred to tears at this scene.
CJ|0|206|1|1|The Three Tears Acceptable To God
CJ|0|206|1|0|NOW THE LONGER Tullia held the little One on her arms, the more she recognized the mistakes she made in her life and therefore wept much from time to time.
CJ|0|206|2|0|Here the little Child sat up and said to Tullia, 'Listen, My dear Tullia! That is something I also do not like about you, that you are constantly weeping now when, after all, you have Me upon your arms.
CJ|0|206|3|0|Be glad now and rejoice - for I take no pleasure in the tears of mankind when they fall where there is no need of them.
CJ|0|206|4|0|Do you really suppose that your tears will cleanse your heart of all sin before Me?
CJ|0|206|5|0|Oh, that is a foolish thought! The tears do indeed glide over your cheeks and dim your eyes, which is even harmful to you -
CJ|0|206|6|0|but the tears do not glide over the heart and do not cleanse it either! Instead they often cause it to become sealed up, and then neither anything good nor bad can enter into it.
CJ|0|206|7|0|And behold, that also brings with it the death of the spirit, which lives in the heart;
CJ|0|206|8|0|for a sorrowful person is always an offended being, and as such is not receptive to anything.
CJ|0|206|9|0|'Only three tears have I laid into the eye of man, and these are: the tear of joy, the tear of pity, and the tear of pain.
CJ|0|206|10|0|These alone do I care to see - but the tear of sorrow, the tear of regret, and the tear of anger, which tears arise from false sympathy for oneself, are fruits of one's own fundamental ego and have little value with Me.
CJ|0|206|11|0|'For the tear of sorrow springs from an offended heart and demands consolation - if this is not forthcoming, such an emotion is easily changed into secret anger and finally into a feeling for revenge.
CJ|0|206|12|0|'The tear of regret is of similar origin and only appears after a sin has been committed, if the sin has afterward drawn a chastising lesson with it.
CJ|0|206|13|0|And then it did not fall because of the sin, but only because of the chastisement and therefore also because of the sin, since this brought the chastisement with it.
CJ|0|206|14|0|This tear also does not make the heart better - for then man does not flee sin because he loves Me, but because he fears punishment, and that is worse than the sin itself!
CJ|0|206|15|0|'And as concerns the tear of anger, it just is not worth My speaking one word about it - for it is a fountain from the pit of hell.
CJ|0|206|16|0|Of course, it is not this tear which now moistens your eye, but only the tear of remorse.
CJ|0|206|17|0|So I say to you: Dry this tear from your eyes also; for you can see that it does not please Me!'
CJ|0|206|18|0|Here Tullia wiped her eyes dry and said, 'O Lord, how infinitely wise and good You are!
CJ|0|206|19|0|Oh how happy and glad I could be if I were no sinner -
CJ|0|206|20|0|but while in Rome I worshiped an idol at the word of the emperor, and this continues to torment me in my heart!'
CJ|0|206|21|0|And the little Child replied, 'i already forgave you that long before you did it.
CJ|0|206|22|0|But you were jealous of the love which Cyrenius had for Me - and that was a gross sin! I have now forgiven you everything and you have no more sin because you love Me again - so be glad and full of good cheer!'
CJ|0|206|23|0|At this Tullia and the others again were full of good cheer, whereupon they all went to the evening meal.
CJ|0|207|1|1|The Lord To The End Of Creation
CJ|0|207|1|0|AFTER THE EVENING MEAL Joseph blessed all the guests, and the little Child also blessed them and said,
CJ|0|207|2|0|'Now all of you go to your rest; and do not be afraid if during the night a little storm will thrust against our house -
CJ|0|207|3|0|for no one will be harmed in the least!
CJ|0|207|4|0|Remember: He who here dwells among you is also a Lord of the storms!'
CJ|0|207|5|0|After these words, which aroused concern for the ship among the ship's company of Cyrenius, a sailor asserted,
CJ|0|207|6|0|'This Child is a regular prophet, for He foretells serious trouble!
CJ|0|207|7|0|Therefore we should immediately go to where the ship of Cyrenius is loosely tied, pull it in to the shore as close as possible and then make it fast!'
CJ|0|207|8|0|Here Jonathan arose and stated, 'Do not worry!
CJ|0|207|9|0|In the first place the Lord will surely know how to protect the ship;
CJ|0|207|10|0|and in the second place I also have people at home who know more about making a ship fast than you, and will surely know how to make the governor's ship fast. So you can be quite unconcerned along with Me!'
CJ|0|207|11|0|These words put everyone at ease and they retired.
CJ|0|207|12|0|Mary promptly made a very soft and fresh bed for the little Child, then laid Him down and placed the little bed beside her sleeping couch.
CJ|0|207|13|0|Now Mary and Eudokia usually slept together in one bed, as they did now.
CJ|0|207|14|0|But Eudokia, who was thoroughly afraid of the predicted storm, confessed to Mary,
CJ|0|207|15|0|'Mary, see, I have a strong fear of the without doubt approaching storm!
CJ|0|207|16|0|How would it be if today we took the little Child in the middle between us?
CJ|0|207|17|0|Then we would surely be safe from every danger!'
CJ|0|207|18|0|And the little Child, upon thus hearing Eudokia express her concern, smiled and said,
CJ|0|207|19|0|'Oh Eudokia, sometimes you are right smart - but other times a real simpleton!
CJ|0|207|20|0|Do you really suppose that I can only protect you when I am on your lap?
CJ|0|207|21|0|Oh, there you are in great error! See, My arm is longer than you suppose.
CJ|0|207|22|0|And if you were at the end of creation, I still would be able to protect you there as well as here.
CJ|0|207|23|0|So just be calm and go to rest as usual, and tomorrow you will arise once more in good health.' - This put Eudokia at ease, and she promptly went to rest along with Mary.
CJ|0|208|1|1|Joseph Puts A Curse On The Storm
CJ|0|208|1|0|TWO HOURS LATER, when everyone was already at rest, a very powerful gale came and thrust against the house so violently that the entire house shook.
CJ|0|208|2|0|All the sleepers were awakened by this resounding blow.
CJ|0|208|3|0|And since the gale continued to rage and was accompanied by a thousand lightnings and the most intense thunder,
CJ|0|208|4|0|all those who were present in Joseph's house began to quake and to quiver thereat.
CJ|0|208|5|0|To the fury and raging of the gale there was also added the howling of a multitude of wild, rending animals, which added to the fear of the guests in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|208|6|0|Everyone now began to press into the chamber where Joseph, Cyrenius and Jonathan were, and sought protection there.
CJ|0|208|7|0|Hereupon Joseph arose, made a light and consoled the fainthearted as well as he could,
CJ|0|208|8|0|and the same was done by the gigantic Jonathan and by Cyrenius.
CJ|0|208|9|0|But since the storm constantly became more violent, the consoling of the three did not have much effect; and what especially caused the greatest fear of death among most of those present was that a few tigers, amid most unearthly howls, began to thrust their paws inside through the barred-up windows.
CJ|0|208|10|0|When the storm became too fierce even for Joseph, he became aroused and shouted at it,
CJ|0|208|11|0|'Be silent, you monster, in the name of Him who dwells here, the Lord of infinity,
CJ|0|208|12|0|and henceforth never disturb those who need rest during the night! So be it!'
CJ|0|208|13|0|These words Joseph shouted with such force that all were more terrified thereat than at the raging gale.
CJ|0|208|14|0|But the storm just would not cease, whereat Joseph became still more aroused and directed his threat at the storm with still greater force.
CJ|0|208|15|0|But this also remained fruitless and the gale mocked Joseph.
CJ|0|208|16|0|Here Joseph became angry at the disobedient gale and put a curse on it.
CJ|0|208|17|0|At this moment the little Child awakened and said to James, who was present beside the little bed,
CJ|0|208|18|0|'James, go in to Joseph and tell him to recall his curse; for he does not know what he curses!
CJ|0|208|19|0|Tomorrow he will understand the reason for this storm and discover its good purpose; in a few minutes it will come to an end anyhow.'
CJ|0|208|20|0|Thereupon James promptly went to Joseph and told him what the little Child had instructed him to say.
CJ|0|208|21|0|Here Joseph took heart and did what James told him, and soon thereafter the storm subsided; the beasts dispersed, and everyone in Joseph's house went back to rest.
CJ|0|209|1|1|The Reason For The Storm
CJ|0|209|1|0|THE FOLLOWING DAY Joseph arose very early as usual and apportioned the daily tasks to his four sons
CJ|0|209|2|0|whose first task it was to provide for a good breakfast, and then to perform whatever duties needed be done.
CJ|0|209|3|0|After attending to this he went outside to see what damage the storm might have caused during the night.
CJ|0|209|4|0|And as he thus walked back and forth, he soon found a mass of gnawed-off human bones,
CJ|0|209|5|0|and found many places that were stained with human blood.
CJ|0|209|6|0|This sight greatly surprised him and he could not solve this riddle.
CJ|0|209|7|0|And as he went onward, he also found a mass of daggers and small lances that were frequently stained with blood.
CJ|0|209|8|0|At this he began to see matters in quite a different light, and slowly began to understand the beneficial reason for the gale and for the wild animals that were brought there because of it.
CJ|0|209|9|0|Thereupon Joseph quickly went to his four sons, made this known to them and told three of them to gather up the bones and the weapons.
CJ|0|209|10|0|In an hour and a half a great heap of human bones was piled up beneath a tree and a second heap of bloody weapons next to it.
CJ|0|209|11|0|After breakfast Joseph led Cyrenius and Jonathan outside and showed them the strange find of the morning.
CJ|0|209|12|0|When Cyrenius beheld this, he struck his hands together above his head and declared,
CJ|0|209|13|0|'But in the name of the almighty Lord, just what is that?
CJ|0|209|14|0|From whence are these bones of the dead? From whence these weapons still dripping with fresh blood?
CJ|0|209|15|0|Joseph, brother, friend, have you no idea as to the cause of this abomination?'
CJ|0|209|16|0|And Joseph answered, 'Friend and brother, those are either sea pirates or the assassins that pursued your ship.
CJ|0|209|17|0|But let us first destroy all of that with fire;
CJ|0|209|18|0|and then we will attempt to get to the bottom of the matter!'
CJ|0|209|19|0|Cyrenius was satisfied with this, and all his household servants were sent to gather in wood from all sides.
CJ|0|209|20|0|And when toward noon a very large pile of wood had been stacked up in an open place, the bones as well as the weapons were laid on the great mound of wood and thus burned up.
CJ|0|210|1|1|The Child Foretells A Fire From Above
CJ|0|210|1|0|AFTER SEVERAL HOURS everything was burned up and nothing was noticed by any of the guests - since the Lord wanted it that way - and no one else knew anything about it except the servants of Cyrenius.
CJ|0|210|2|0|Only then did Tullia, Maronius Pilla and the chief officers and centurions along with Mary and with James, who led the little Child, come out of the house into the open for the first time this day.
CJ|0|210|3|0|Now Maronius Pilla, whose sense of smell was very keen, immediately noticed an odor of burning,
CJ|0|210|4|0|went directly to Joseph and inquired, 'Most noble friend, do you not notice an odor of a wild conflagration in your nostrils?'
CJ|0|210|5|0|Here Joseph led him somewhat aside behind the house and with his finger pointed out the scene of the fire to him.
CJ|0|210|6|0|And Maronius asked just what had been delivered up to the fire there.
CJ|0|210|7|0|Joseph answered, 'Friend, that is just why the matter was delivered up to the fire, so it should not catch the eyes of the world!
CJ|0|210|8|0|Now Cyrenius knows everything, so turn to him. He will tell you what was there, for he saw it all.'
CJ|0|210|9|0|With that Maronius had to be satisfied, and with him several other curious inquirers.
CJ|0|210|10|0|Thereupon the little Child requested that Joseph, Cyrenius, Jonathan and His James come along with Him to the scene of the fire, which here and there still gave off wisps of smoke.
CJ|0|210|11|0|When they arrived there, the little Child ran three times around the large fire area, took a half-burned dagger, gave it to Cyrenius and stated,
CJ|0|210|12|0|'Cyrenius, see, now your enemies are defeated, and their strength is turned to ashes!
CJ|0|210|13|0|Here in My hand is the last hostile remnant, and it has become useless.
CJ|0|210|14|0|I give it to you as a token that henceforth you shall take no revenge against those who were against you - and the few who still are;
CJ|0|210|15|0|for as useless and reduced to slag as this dagger shall also be all your anger as well as that of your few remaining enemies!
CJ|0|210|16|0|'These your enemies went forth from Tyre and wanted to destroy you here.
CJ|0|210|17|0|Now I knew the day and the hour and the moment that you were in danger.
CJ|0|210|18|0|Therefore I had a storm come at the right time last night, which drove the wild animals down from the hills
CJ|0|210|19|0|and caused great fear and terror among the assassins, so that they became helpless when they were attached by the beasts.
CJ|0|210|20|0|'And behold, thus it will be one day in the future: A mighty fire from above will come over the bones of all the doers of evil and will devour them to dust and ashes!
CJ|0|210|21|0|Then will the Lord pass three times around the scene of the world's conflagration, and no one will ask Him and say: Lord, what are You doing?
CJ|0|210|22|0|And only at the third time around shall the last ray of anger be taken from the earth!'
CJ|0|210|23|0|At these words all were wide-eyed, for no one understood their meaning.
CJ|0|211|1|1|The Child Warns Joseph Against Vain Searching
CJ|0|211|1|0|AFTER A WHILE Joseph went over to the little Child and asked Him how such was to be understood.
CJ|0|211|2|0|And the little Child replied, 'Joseph, here you seek in vain-
CJ|0|211|3|0|for there are many things indeed which will not be disclosed to you while you live on the earth.
CJ|0|211|4|0|But whoever after this life will enter into My kingdom spiritually, to him everything will be shown in the light.
CJ|0|211|5|0|So do not ask about things here that do no concern you at this time.
CJ|0|211|6|0|Now have soil brought over so this fire area may be covered with it.'
CJ|0|211|7|0|Here Joseph turned to Cyrenius who promptly had soil brought over by his servants and the area of the fire covered therewith.
CJ|0|211|8|0|By the time this was done it was noon, and the midday meal already stood prepared by the sons of Joseph who kept it in readiness for the many guests.
CJ|0|211|9|0|The little Child now said to Joseph, 'I have already become quite hungry - three large fish are fried, so let us go to dinner.'
CJ|0|211|10|0|Here Joseph said, 'That is a good idea, but will the fish really be sufficient for more than a hundred people?'
CJ|0|211|11|0|The little Child answered, 'You have surely seen the great creatures - how then can you ask?
CJ|0|211|12|0|Each fish weighs a good hundred pounds, so there really is no need of any more, and there is enough for two hundred people.
CJ|0|211|13|0|So let us go home now, for I am already very hungry - and especially for the good fish of the Mediterranean.'
CJ|0|211|14|0|Thereupon Joseph promptly called everyone to the noon meal and went inside the villa.
CJ|0|211|15|0|On the way to the villa Cyrenius asked the lovely little Child whether this sea really was a sea in the middle of the land (Mare Mediterraneum).
CJ|0|211|16|0|And the little Child replied, 'Whether right or not - I must of course speak with all of you according to your kind if I want to be understood by you.
CJ|0|211|17|0|After the meal you can look it up on the little earth-globe, and there you will undoubtedly find out whether this expression fits.'
CJ|0|211|18|0|The little Child now ran ahead with His James to be at the table as soon as possible.
CJ|0|211|19|0|When Joseph arrived, the little Child smiled at him from the table while already holding a piece of fish in His hand.
CJ|0|211|20|0|Joseph was secretly quite happy at this, but said for the sake of propriety,
CJ|0|211|21|0|'Well, well, my dearest little Child, such a big piece! Will You really be able to eat it all?'
CJ|0|211|22|0|And the little Child smiled still more and answered, 'Do not worry about that, for your fathers have already seen to it that nothing can easily harm My stomach. For they have often served Me with the largest and worst scraps.' - Here Joseph well understood what the little Child meant.
CJ|0|212|1|1|The Child And James Forget To Pray
CJ|0|212|1|0|JOSEPH NOW said his usual table prayer and blessed the food
CJ|0|212|2|0|and then asked the little Child if He had also prayed.
CJ|0|212|3|0|Here the little Child smiled again and said to James,
CJ|0|212|4|0|'Say, now we are going to catch it! For we have both forgotten to ask the blessing and to give thanks and have already eaten of the fish.
CJ|0|212|5|0|You speak now as well as you can, otherwise we are sure to be punished again and will have to fast a bit.'
CJ|0|212|6|0|And James, somewhat embarrassed, answered, 'Dear father Joseph, I ask your forgiveness - for this time, along with my Jesus, I have really forgotten to pray!'
CJ|0|212|7|0|When Joseph heard this from James, his face took on a somewhat threatening look and he stated,
CJ|0|212|8|0|'Since you have forgotten to pray, you can also forget to eat until evening, and in the meantime you can now go for a little walk out in the open.'
CJ|0|212|9|0|At this the little Child smiled at James and said, 'Well, there we have it! Did I not say a little while ago that we would have to fast?
CJ|0|212|10|0|But wait just a little longer - I want to speak a few words with Joseph first.
CJ|0|212|11|0|Perhaps he will relent a bit as concerns the fasting until evening.'
CJ|0|212|12|0|And James said in a low tone of voice, 'Lord, You do what seems best to You, and I shall follow Your example.'
CJ|0|212|13|0|Thereupon the little Child asked, 'Joseph, are you really serious about that?'
CJ|0|212|14|0|And Joseph replied, 'Yes, of course; for whoever does not pray, he shall not eat either!'
CJ|0|212|15|0|At this the little Child smiled once more and said, 'Now that is what I call being strict!
CJ|0|212|16|0|See, if I were as strict as you now are, a great many who still eat today, although they did not pray, would have to do penance by fasting!
CJ|0|212|17|0|I really would like to hear from you for once why and exactly to whom I should pray.
CJ|0|212|18|0|And then I would also like to find out from you just exactly to whom you pray in your prayer, and to whom poor James should have prayed.'
CJ|0|212|19|0|Here Joseph replied, 'To the Lord God, Your holy Father must you pray, since He is holy, most holy!'
CJ|0|212|20|0|And the little Child retorted, 'You are certainly correct there -
CJ|0|212|21|0|but the unfortunate part of the matter is that you just do not know the Father of all glory to whom you pray.
CJ|0|212|22|0|And you will not recognize this Father for a long time because your old, habitual blindness hinders you therein.'
CJ|0|212|23|0|The little Child then said to James, 'Let us go outside now, and you will see that out in the open one can also get something to eat without prayer.'
CJ|0|212|24|0|Thereupon the little Child went outside with His James and did not allow Himself to be detained.
CJ|0|213|1|1|Joseph Repents His Mistake
CJ|0|213|1|0|WHEN THE LITTLE CHILD and James were outside, Mary said to Joseph,
CJ|0|213|2|0|'Listen, my dear husband and father Joseph, sometimes you are really a bit too strict towards the divine Child!
CJ|0|213|3|0|What could one otherwise expect of a normal child aged two and one-third years?
CJ|0|213|4|0|Who would subject Him to such stern discipline?
CJ|0|213|5|0|But you are as strict in your discipline against the Child of all children as if He were of a heaven only knows ripe age!
CJ|0|213|6|0|See, that seems very unreasonable to me. Even though you love Him beyond measure now and then, you are sometimes so strict with Him as if you had no love towards Him at all!'
CJ|0|213|7|0|This tone of Mary immediately found an echo in Cyrenius, Jonathan, Tullia, Eudokia and Maronius Pilla.
CJ|0|213|8|0|And Cyrenius in addition protested to Joseph, 'Friend, sometimes I really do not know what to make of you!
CJ|0|213|9|0|First you teach me to recognize the most high Deity in the little Child Himself -
CJ|0|213|10|0|right after which you again demand of the little Child that He should worship a God!
CJ|0|213|11|0|Tell me, how does that harmonize? If the little Child is the Divine Being Himself, how then should He pray to a God? - Does your demand not seem a bit absurd to you?
CJ|0|213|12|0|I will make the supposition the little Child were not what I now quite without question recognize Him to be and always worship Him as such.
CJ|0|213|13|0|Then I would say, that coming from a true friend of children, your request seems a bit foolish!
CJ|0|213|14|0|For who will demand a serious prayer of a child nine quarter years old?
CJ|0|213|15|0|For that reason you will surely see my point of view, when I as a pagan say to you:
CJ|0|213|16|0|'Friend, you must be struck with a three-fold blindness if you are not always able to esteem the little Child at His true worth!
CJ|0|213|17|0|Truly, this time I certainly will not eat a bite if the little Child with His James will not be present here at my side!
CJ|0|213|18|0|Is it not even ridiculous if you entreat the Lord God for a blessing upon the food and then order the same Lord and God away from the table, because He did not pray according to your habitual manner?
CJ|0|213|19|0|That is surely why the little Child also asked you just to whom He should pray, and to whom you pray, and also to whom James should have prayed.
CJ|0|213|20|0|But as I see it, you do not seem to have noticed what the little Child wanted to tell you therewith!'
CJ|0|213|21|0|These quite to the point remarks went straight to Joseph's heart, and he went outside to get the little Child as well as James,
CJ|0|213|22|0|But there he called James and the little Child in vain, for both had quickly gone away - to where, no one knew.
CJ|0|214|1|1|The Lord's Table On The Mountain
CJ|0|214|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH became afraid, so he quickly called his four oldest sons and said to them,
CJ|0|214|2|0|'Go and help me look for the little Child and for James - for I have sinned against the Child and am greatly afraid in my heart!'
CJ|0|214|3|0|And the four sons hurriedly went out in all directions and sought the little Child for an hour, but they found Him nowhere and came home empty-handed.
CJ|0|214|4|0|When Joseph saw that the four sons came home alone, his heart was full of anguish and he went outside and walked quite a distance from the villa where he wept very bitterly over his supposed transgression against the Child.
CJ|0|214|5|0|While he was thus weeping, he heard a voice which said to him,
CJ|0|214|6|0|'Joseph, you just man, weep not, and do not let yourself be disturbed in your heart by the children of men!
CJ|0|214|7|0|For I, whom you now seek fearfully and in disquiet of soul, am closer to you than you think.
CJ|0|214|8|0|Just go forward now in the direction in which you are facing, and your eyes will see Him who now speaks to you and whom you seek!'
CJ|0|214|9|0|At these wondrous words Joseph arose comforted and hurriedly went forward through the fields for about a half hour's walk in the direction he faced.
CJ|0|214|10|0|And as he thus walked, he came to a hill of considerable size which was one-hundred and seventy fathoms high.
CJ|0|214|11|0|There he thought and said to himself, 'Shall I also climb this hill in this great heat?'
CJ|0|214|12|0|And the voice said again, 'Yes, you must also climb this hill - for only at the summit shall your eyes behold the Lord, whom you did not see as He sat with you at the table!'
CJ|0|214|13|0|When Joseph heard this, he paid no attention to the great heat and hurriedly went up the hill.
CJ|0|214|14|0|But as he neared the top, he found it wrapped in a dense mist and was greatly surprised that such a little hill had a mist at this time of the year; for it was the time around Easter.
CJ|0|214|15|0|And as he was thus wondering, lo, James and the little Child appeared out of the mists, and the little Child said,
CJ|0|214|16|0|'Joseph, do not hold back and joyfully come with Me to the summit of this hill
CJ|0|214|17|0|and there convince yourself that now is not the time in which the Lord shall fast, and that because He did not pray!
CJ|0|214|18|0|A time will indeed come in which the Lord will fast, but that is still to come. - And so follow Me!'
CJ|0|214|19|0|At this Joseph followed the little Child and soon came to the top.
CJ|0|214|20|0|When he arrived at the top, the mists departed, and upon a finely polished crossbeam of cedar-wood he saw a roasted lamb, a goblet full of precious wine and a loaf of the finest wheat bread.
CJ|0|214|21|0|At this Joseph was greatly surprised and inquired, 'But from where did you two take all this? Did the angels bring you that, or did You, o Lord, create it all?'
CJ|0|214|22|0|And the little Child looked toward the sun and said, 'Joseph, look, this luminary of the earth also boards at My table!
CJ|0|214|23|0|And I tell you: she requires more sustenance in one hour than this earth, which carries you, amounts to - and behold, she has never suffered from hunger or thirst! And such boarders I have in countless numbers and of incomparably greater size!
CJ|0|214|24|0|Do you really suppose that I shall fast when you order Me away from the table if I do not wish to worship Myself at an inappropriate time?
CJ|0|214|25|0|Oh see, of that the Lord has no need. Now come to My table and dine with Me - but this time without your habitual prayer.
CJ|0|214|26|0|'For love to Me is the true prayer - if you have this, then you can at all times save your lips the trouble!' And Joseph went over and ate and drank at the true table of the Lord, and found the food to have a truly heavenly flavor.
CJ|0|215|1|1|In Hoc Signo Vinces
CJ|0|215|1|0|AFTER THIS HEAVENLY MEAL on top of the little mountain, Joseph said to the little Child,
CJ|0|215|2|0|'My Lord and my God! I, a poor old man beseech You, forgive me if I have no doubt offended You; and come back into the house again with me.
CJ|0|215|3|0|For without You I can never go back; and if I do go back without You, everyone will turn against me quite bitterly and will punish me with hard words.'
CJ|0|215|4|0|Here the little Child answered, 'Yes, yes, I will of course go with you, for here I shall not set up a place and remain.
CJ|0|215|5|0|But one thing I require of you, and that is that you take this My table upon your shoulders and carry it homeward ahead of Me.
CJ|0|215|6|0|And do not shrink from its burden - for while it will indeed press on you a bit, it will not bend you nor weaken you in the least!'
CJ|0|215|7|0|At these words Joseph took the beautiful cross while James took the left-overs from the meal and thus they started on the way back with the little Child in the middle.
CJ|0|215|8|0|After a while Joseph said to the little Child, 'Listen, my dearly beloved Jesus, the cross is heavy after all! Can we not rest a bit?'
CJ|0|215|9|0|And the little Child answered, 'You have already carried greater burdens as a carpenter, which I did not lay upon you;
CJ|0|215|10|0|and behold, there you would not grant yourself a rest until you carried your burden to its destination!
CJ|0|215|11|0|Now you are carrying only a little burden for Me for the first time and already want to rest after a thousand steps?
CJ|0|215|12|0|Oh Joseph, carry,carry My light burden without a rest, and you will find a fitting reward in My kingdom!
CJ|0|215|13|0|See, through this cross you will become aware of My burden, and it will tell you by its small weight what I am to you in the world!
CJ|0|215|14|0|And when you will leave this world in My arms, then this cross will become a fiery wagon of Elias to you, in which you will ascend before Me in greatest joy!'
CJ|0|215|15|0|After these words the aged Joseph kissed the fairly heavy cross and carried it onward without a rest;
CJ|0|215|16|0|and it did not seem nearly as heavy to him any more, so that he brought it all the way to the villa quite easily.
CJ|0|215|17|0|In the meantime everyone in the villa was in a state of highest expectancy and filled with great concern, wondering from which direction Joseph might return with the little Child and with James.
CJ|0|215|18|0|And when Mary, Cyrenius and the others finally caught sight of the approaching three, they lost all restraint!
CJ|0|215|19|0|Everyone ran toward them with open arms, and Mary at once seized the little Child and pressed Him to her heart with convulsive love.
CJ|0|215|20|0|But Cyrenius was surprised that Joseph would carry a gallows, as the symbol of the greatest degradation and shame, home on his shoulders.
CJ|0|215|21|0|And the little Child upon the mother's arms sat up and said to Cyrenius,
CJ|0|215|22|0|'Truly, truly, this symbol of the greatest degradation will become a symbol of the highest honor!
CJ|0|215|23|0|If you are not going to carry it after Me in this manner, as Joseph now carries it, you will not enter into My kingdom in the future!' - These words brought Cyrenius to silence, and he asked no more about Joseph's burden.
CJ|0|216|1|1|The Way Of The Lord With The Pagans
CJ|0|216|1|0|AND THEY ALL went back into the house where they took place at the table according to the will of the little Child.
CJ|0|216|2|0|For not one of the leading guests had eaten a bite; and the three large fish still lay there almost untouched.
CJ|0|216|3|0|And since several hours had passed while the little Child was being sought and evening was approaching,
CJ|0|216|4|0|the fish naturally became cold, in which state the Jews were usually not permitted to eat them:
CJ|0|216|5|0|But as the sun had not set, it was still permissible to eat the fish; only it was required that they be reheated and thoroughly warmed up.
CJ|0|216|6|0|Therefore Joseph immediately called his four cooks and ordered them to reheat the fish.
CJ|0|216|7|0|Here the little Child said, 'Joseph, that is not necessary; for from now on the fish may also be eaten cold, if only they have been fried before that.
CJ|0|216|8|0|So instead of frying them again, have lemons and fresh oil brought,
CJ|0|216|9|0|and the fish will taste better that way than if they were refried.'
CJ|0|216|10|0|Joseph promptly followed the advice of the little Child and had a whole basket of lemons and a large container of fresh oil brought.
CJ|0|216|11|0|At this all the guests became desirous for this new fare, wondering just how it would taste.
CJ|0|216|12|0|Cyrenius was the first who took a sizable piece of fish for himself and put oil and the juice of a lemon on it.
CJ|0|216|13|0|And as he began to eat, he could not give enough praise to the wonderful flavor of the thus prepared fish.
CJ|0|216|14|0|At this experience of the governor the other guests also helped themselves, and they all found this fare to have such excellent taste that they also could not find sufficient words of praise.
CJ|0|216|15|0|When Joseph had made a test of a sizeable portion of fish himself, he asserted,
CJ|0|216|16|0|'Truly, if Moses had ever partaken of a thus prepared fish, he surely would have put this food on his fare also.
CJ|0|216|17|0|But he just must not have been as well informed as concerns the art of cooking than You, my dearest Jesus.'
CJ|0|216|18|0|Here the little Child smiled cordially and said in a very friendly way,
CJ|0|216|19|0|'My dear father Joseph, the reason lies in this:
CJ|0|216|20|0|With Moses in the desert the rule was: Hunger is the best cook! and the people would often have eaten raw meat out of hunger and met their death;
CJ|0|216|21|0|therefore Moses had to prescribe his fare and the foods had to be eaten fresh and warm.
CJ|0|216|22|0|But now the rule is and will always continue to be: The Lord is the best cook. And there one can also enjoy a cold fish with lemon and oil.
CJ|0|216|23|0|And that is because the cold but still well-fried fish represents the state of the pagans, the lemon juice represents My power which harmonizes and pulls them together, and the oil represents My Word to them - Now do you understand why the fish tastes better this way?' - All were deeply affected at this and were greatly surprised at the wisdom of the little Child.
CJ|0|217|1|1|A Lesson In Geometry
CJ|0|217|1|0|WHEN ALL HAD STILLED their hunger with the cold fish they arose, thanked Joseph for this good meal and then went out into the open; for the sun was still above the horizon.
CJ|0|217|2|0|When most of the guests from Cyrenius' company had gone outside, the little Child asked him,
CJ|0|217|3|0|'Cyrenius, do you not recall what you asked Me out there at the scene of the fire, when I praised the fish of the Mediterranean for their quality and fine taste?'
CJ|0|217|4|0|Here Cyrenius considered a bit but could not remember his question.
CJ|0|217|5|0|He therefore said to the little Child, 'O my Lord, my life, forgive me - I must confess before You that I have completely forgotten it!'
CJ|0|217|6|0|Here the little Child smiled again and full of gentleness reminded the somewhat embarrassed Cyrenius,
CJ|0|217|7|0|'Did you not ask Me whether the Mediterranean is in the middle of the land?
CJ|0|217|8|0|I then referred you to the small earth-globe at which you were to look and decide for yourself whether this sea is really in the middle of the land.
CJ|0|217|9|0|See, now would surely be the best time to settle this matter!
CJ|0|217|10|0|So take the little earth in your hand and find the answer to your question.'
CJ|0|217|11|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Yes, by my poor soul, this I surely would have completely forgotten if You, o Lord, had not reminded me of it now.'
CJ|0|217|12|0|Here James at once sprang into the side chamber and brought the little earth to Cyrenius
CJ|0|217|13|0|who then promptly sought and soon found the Mediterranean.
CJ|0|217|14|0|And as he pointed to the Mediterranean with his finger, the little Child asked him,
CJ|0|217|15|0|'Cyrenius, is that really the middle of the land? Or how does the matter seem to you?'
CJ|0|217|16|0|Cyrenius answered, 'I dare say that I am good at figures according to Euclid and Ptolemy
CJ|0|217|17|0|and therefore know from the geometry of spheres that on the surface of a ball every given point is in the middle of the surface because in the first place each point is precisely the same distance from the center of the ball,
CJ|0|217|18|0|and secondly because all lines going out from it to its corresponding point on the opposite side of the ball are of the same curvature and length.
CJ|0|217|19|0|According to this basic axiom it follows that this sea can be named the Mediterranean.
CJ|0|217|20|0|But on the other hand I also find that every sea is in the same category and can be a sea in the middle just as well.'
CJ|0|217|21|0|And the little Child rejoined, 'Therein you are quite right; but for all that the principles of Euclid still do not apply here,
CJ|0|217|22|0|and this sea can still be called a sea in the middle exclusively -
CJ|0|217|23|0|for wherever the Lord is, there also is the true middle.
CJ|0|217|24|0|And behold, the Lord is now here by this sea, and therefore the middle of the sea is also here.
CJ|0|217|25|0|That is a different computation of which Euclid did not dream, and it is more correct than his."
CJ|0|217|26|0|This explanation greatly alerted Cyrenius and he continued to study the globe.
CJ|0|218|1|1|Faith Demonstrates True Humility Of The Spirit
CJ|0|218|1|0|THEREUPON THE LITTLE CHILD said to Cyrenius as the latter began to investigate other matters on the little globe,
CJ|0|218|2|0|'Cyrenius, you continue to search in vain and promptly want the whole hand where I have shown you one finger!
CJ|0|218|3|0|See, that is out of the question; for everything requires its time and its established, immutable order!
CJ|0|218|4|0|When you see a tree blossom, you would of course already like to have the ripe fruit.
CJ|0|218|5|0|But that cannot be; for every tree has its time and its order.
CJ|0|218|6|0|'Now time and order are established by Me from eternity, so I cannot go against Myself;
CJ|0|218|7|0|neither can anything be taken away from time and from order.
CJ|0|218|8|0|I do indeed love you in all fullness of My divine power, but for all that I still cannot grant you even a minute of fleeting time,
CJ|0|218|9|0|for this must flow onward like an incessant stream and has no rest until it has reached the great shore of eternity, which is ever constant and unchangeable.
CJ|0|218|10|0|'Thus your continued probing into My mysteries is rather vain.
CJ|0|218|11|0|For by such an approach you still will not come a hair's breadth closer to My depths until the proper time.
CJ|0|218|12|0|Cease therefore from such inquiries and do not burden your spirit in vain - for at the proper time all that shall freely be yours from Me!
CJ|0|218|13|0|'Now you would like to fully comprehend why the middle is there where I am?
CJ|0|218|14|0|But I say to you: such you cannot grasp at present - therefore you should first believe and by faith demonstrate the true humility of your spirit.
CJ|0|218|15|0|Once your spirit by means of humility has reached the proper depth in itself, then you will also have a clear insight into My depths from this depth.
CJ|0|218|16|0|But when you exalt your spirit by searching My depths, then it will leave its living depth ever more and more, and thereby you will alienate yourself from my depths and not come near to them again.
CJ|0|218|17|0|'Yes, I will add: from now on all deep wisdom shall remain hidden from the wise of the world -
CJ|0|218|18|0|but it shall be laid into the hearts of those without guile, the weak children and the orphans!
CJ|0|218|19|0|For that reason become a child in your heart, and then will be the right time for your to receive true wisdom!'
CJ|0|218|20|0|Cyrenius was greatly amazed at this doctrine and asked the little Child, saying,
CJ|0|218|21|0|'Well, if so, then no one may learn to read the letters nor write the script?
CJ|0|218|22|0|For if You freely give all that to him who is worthy, why then the laborious learning?'
CJ|0|218|23|0|And the little Child answered, 'By means of proper and humble learning the acre is made fertile for wisdom, and that is also in My order.
CJ|0|218|24|0|But you must not look upon the act of learning as the end or as wisdom itself, but only as a means.
CJ|0|218|25|0|For when the acre is made fertile, I shall surely spread the seed from which the proper wisdom will sprout forth! Do you understand that?' - At this Cyrenius was silent and probed no more.
CJ|0|219|1|1|The Cross As Symbol Of God's Love
CJ|0|219|1|0|AFTER THIS MOST ENLIGHTENING DISCUSSION between the little Child and Cyrenius, Joseph also turned to the little Child and asked Him what was to be done now with the cross that had been brought home.
CJ|0|219|2|0|And the little Child replied, 'Joseph, I tell you, that has already found its man and its place!
CJ|0|219|3|0|Now you say to a merchant: You have a good product which you will not have for long;
CJ|0|219|4|0|for some buyer who is undoubtedly anxious to buy it will soon appear.
CJ|0|219|5|0|And behold, I am also that kind of a merchant! I have brought a good product to be sold to whoever will buy it.
CJ|0|219|6|0|And a buyer has already appeared and has brought it into his possession through his love to Me -
CJ|0|219|7|0|and that buyer is Jonathan, the strong fisherman.
CJ|0|219|8|0|Should he then not receive anything for his many fish with which he so often has generously supplied us in the past?
CJ|0|219|9|0|'One hand washes the other. Whoever gives water, to him water shall be given in return.
CJ|0|219|10|0|Whoever gives oil, he shall be repaid in oil.
CJ|0|219|11|0|Whoever gives comfort, to him comfort shall be given eternally.
CJ|0|219|12|0|And whoever gives love, he shall also be repaid with love.
CJ|0|219|13|0|Now Jonathan has given Me all his love - therefore I also gave him My love in this cross.
CJ|0|219|14|0|You others have, to be sure, also given Me love with water and oil -
CJ|0|219|15|0|but I tell you, Joseph: Pure love is valued more highly by Me than that with water and oil!
CJ|0|219|16|0|'For the cross has now become My greatest love!
CJ|0|219|17|0|Therefore I gave it to Jonathan because of his great love to Me -
CJ|0|219|18|0|for he alone loves Me because of Myself, and that is pure love.
CJ|0|219|19|0|He loved Me without knowing who I am - but you others loved Me less although you knew who I really am.
CJ|0|219|20|0|And behold, that was a love with a great deal of water! For that reason you shall never suffer a lack of water in this world, namely in your eyes.
CJ|0|219|21|0|Cyrenius loved Me with oil - so he shall in days to come also be anointed with the oil of life, as you shall be given to drink of the water of life.
CJ|0|219|22|0|But in the future only those who really love Me shall fully dwell with Me!'
CJ|0|219|23|0|This discourse of the little Child made Joseph thoroughly afraid, and Cyrenius himself made big eyes.
CJ|0|219|24|0|Thereupon the little Child added, 'But on that account you others should not suppose that I shall withhold the cross from you - for whoever has a heart free from the world shall also receive the free cross!' - This enlightenment put Joseph and Cyrenius at ease again in their hearts.
CJ|0|220|1|1|The Flesh Is Under The Debt Of Sin
CJ|0|220|1|0|DURING THIS DISCOURSE of the little Child, Jonathan, impelled his ardent feeling of love, fell down in front of the little Child and wept in his extreme joy and gratitude.
CJ|0|220|2|0|And the little Child said to the others, 'Do you see how mighty Jonathan's love to Me is?
CJ|0|220|3|0|Truly I tell you: From every tear which now quells from his eyes, a world shall come into being for him in My kingdom!
CJ|0|220|4|0|I have in fact already shown you the value and the difference between tears - but here I tell you once more:
CJ|0|220|5|0|No tear is valued more highly by Me than that which is like the tear of Jonathan.'
CJ|0|220|6|0|At these words of the little Child the huge Jonathan took hold of himself and declared,
CJ|0|220|7|0|'O You almighty Lord of my life! How can I, a great sinner, really be worthy of such infinitely great compassion and grace from You?'
CJ|0|220|8|0|And the little Child affirmed: 'Jonathan, ask yourself how you can possibly love Me so mightily in your heart when you are such a great sinner?
CJ|0|220|9|0|Is love toward Me not holy in itself, as I am holy in My divine Being?
CJ|0|220|10|0|How then can you, as so great a sinner, be capable of enduring such holy love in your heart?
CJ|0|220|11|0|Does not every man become sanctified and wholly newborn by means of love toward God in his heart?
CJ|0|220|12|0|Now if you are filled with this love, say, what accordingly is in you that you call sin?
CJ|0|220|13|0|'See, every man's flesh is in fact a sin in itself; therefore every man's flesh must also die.
CJ|0|220|14|0|Yes, I say to you: even this flesh of My body is under the debt of sin and therefore will have to die just like yours.
CJ|0|220|15|0|But this sin is after all not voluntary, but only one under judgment and is no debt whatever for your free spirit.
CJ|0|220|16|0|For that reason your worth is determined not according to your flesh, but entirely according to your love - which is free.
CJ|0|220|17|0|And it will not be said in the world of the spirit: How was your body, but: How was your love?
CJ|0|220|18|0|'Behold, if you throw a stone into the air, it does not remain in the air but soon falls back to the earth again.
CJ|0|220|19|0|Why so? - Because it is attracted by the matter of the earth as a love under judgment, which wholly constitutes the stone itself.
CJ|0|220|20|0|Why then do not the clouds and the stars fall from heaven? - Because they are attracted by the love of heaven!
CJ|0|220|21|0|Consequently, if your heart is full of love toward God, the eternally Living, where indeed will this love draw you, since it alone is free and alive in itself?'
CJ|0|220|22|0|This last question filled all those present with the greatest bliss, and they all knew where they stood.
CJ|0|221|1|1|The Same Conditions Do Not Apply Everywhere
CJ|0|221|1|0|AFTER JONATHAN WAS thus enlightened, as well as all those present, Joseph suggested,
CJ|0|221|2|0|'Friends, it is a beautiful evening - how would it be if before going to our night's rest we went out into the open for an hour?
CJ|0|221|3|0|For it is extremely sultry in these rooms,
CJ|0|221|4|0|and if one goes to bed now, one can neither rest nor sleep.
CJ|0|221|5|0|Here the little Child said, 'Joseph, I am of that opinion too; only there should not be so many bothersome insects buzzing around outside - then it would be more pleasant to be outside in the evening.'
CJ|0|221|6|0|And Joseph agreed, 'Yes, my life, there You are indeed right.
CJ|0|221|7|0|If there were only a means by which it were possible to get rid of these bothersome little guests without going against Your order, that would be most desirable.
CJ|0|221|8|0|And the little Child replied, 'Oh, such a means can no doubt be found quickly!
CJ|0|221|9|0|Go and get a bowl full of warm cow's milk and put it outside, and you will see how all these thousands upon thousands of bothersome little guests will surround the bowl - and will leave us in peace.'
CJ|0|221|10|0|Joseph now promptly told his sons to put a bowl of warm cow's milk outside,
CJ|0|221|11|0|and the sons quickly carried out Joseph's wish.
CJ|0|221|12|0|And when the bowl of warm milk had been placed into the open, an enormous swarm of all manner of stinging insects soon appeared above the milkbowl in the faint evening twilight.
CJ|0|221|13|0|All were surprised at this ingenuity by which millions of midges and gnats gathered together at one point and there waged a veritable milk war with each other.
CJ|0|221|14|0|At this Cyrenius asserted, 'See, how simple and really practical this measure is.
CJ|0|221|15|0|A hardly noticeable bowl full of warm milk frees us from the bothersome nuisance of insects.
CJ|0|221|16|0|Truly, that shall soon be carried out in Tyre also.
CJ|0|221|17|0|For there millions of such creatures annoy the people in the evening.'
CJ|0|221|18|0|And the little Child stated, 'The means is indeed quite good, but it will not be possible to apply it everywhere successfully -
CJ|0|221|19|0|for the same conditions do not apply everywhere,
CJ|0|221|20|0|and such conditions as are now to be found here probably do not exist anywhere else!
CJ|0|221|21|0|Therefore this remedy works so excellently only here. For where these conditions are not to be found, this remedy will not work so well either. -
CJ|0|221|22|0|Now look up to the sky, and you will discover a comet!' Hereat Cyrenius looked upward and at once saw a large comet.
CJ|0|222|1|1|When Zero Counts As Much As A Million
CJ|0|222|1|0|WHEN CYRENIUS HAD TAKEN a good, long look at the large comet, he declared,
CJ|0|222|2|0|'Truly, an unusual star! It is the first one I have seen -
CJ|0|222|3|0|but I have of course heard of these mythical bearers of ill tidings in the sky a number of times.'
CJ|0|222|4|0|At this remark of Cyrenius, Maronius Pilla also came over and asserted,
CJ|0|222|5|0|'Just look at that! The temple of Janus is hardly closed seven years, and everyone said:
CJ|0|222|6|0|Now Rome will have eternal peace! for it is said that this temple has never been closed this long.
CJ|0|222|7|0|And now we already have the terrible sign in front of our eyes that the temple of Janus will be unlocked again quite soon,
CJ|0|222|8|0|and that matters will become very lively on the great fields of Mars!'
CJ|0|222|9|0|Joseph then asked Maronius Pilla if he really considered such a comet to be a harbinger of war.
CJ|0|222|10|0|And Maronius Pilla replied quite seriously, 'Oh friend, that is an unalterable truth! I tell you: war upon war!'
CJ|0|222|11|0|Here Cyrenius remarked, 'Now we have the right pair together for once!
CJ|0|222|12|0|Joseph still holds mightily to his Moses, and Maronius Pilla cannot get rid of his old, heathenish superstition!'
CJ|0|222|13|0|At this Joseph protested, 'Esteemed friend and brother Cyrenius! I would say that Moses is surely better than the temple of Janus in Rome.'
CJ|0|222|14|0|And Cyrenius retorted, 'Of course! But if one has the Lord Jehovah Himself in His fullness, I would say that Moses as well as the dull Janus should step quite far into the background, and that once and for all.
CJ|0|222|15|0|The comet according to ancient, unfounded fables does indeed seem to be a bearer of ill tidings -
CJ|0|222|16|0|but I believe that our dearest Jesus and Lord in the fullness of His Deity also happens to be a Lord over this supposed lord of misfortune. Do you not agree with me?'
CJ|0|222|17|0|And Joseph answered, 'That surely; but for all that Moses is still not to be compared with the Janus of Rome, not even in this presence of the Lord.'
CJ|0|222|18|0|Cyrenius agreed, 'I do not want to do that either - but if I have the Lord, then at least to me Moses and Janus are the same.'
CJ|0|222|19|0|Here the little Child said to Cyrenius, 'Stay with that!
CJ|0|222|20|0|For truly, where infinity is concerned, all magnitudes fade and zero counts as much as a million.'
CJ|0|222|21|0|This answer of the little Child jarred Joseph a bit, and thereafter he did not uphold Moses to Cyrenius any more.
CJ|0|223|1|1|A Comet In Miniature
CJ|0|223|1|0|JONATHAN, who on such occasions always delved strongly into the cause, now came to Joseph and said,
CJ|0|223|2|0|'Brother, here is something else again where the Lord, as recently at the eclipse of the moon, could straighten us out!
CJ|0|223|3|0|Do you suppose that He would enlighten us if we asked Him about it?'
CJ|0|223|4|0|Joseph answered, 'My dear brother Jonathan, the matter needs only to be put to the test!
CJ|0|223|5|0|Whoever puts all his trust in the Lord builds on a firm foundation.
CJ|0|223|6|0|Go over to the little Child who is now on Mary's lap and ask Him,
CJ|0|223|7|0|and you will soon receive an answer to your question.'
CJ|0|223|8|0|Upon this reply Jonathan at once in all love and humility went over to the little Child and wanted to ask;
CJ|0|223|9|0|but the little Child anticipated Jonathan and said,
CJ|0|223|10|0|'Jonathan, I already know what you want - but that is too deep for you!
CJ|0|223|11|0|Go into the house now and take a small torch,
CJ|0|223|12|0|light it, and then go with the burning torch over to the milkbowl that has been set out for the midges and gnats,
CJ|0|223|13|0|and I tell you, there you will also see a comet as well as its fundamental nature.'
CJ|0|223|14|0|At this Jonathan quickly did what the little Child had advised him to do.
CJ|0|223|15|0|And lo, when he brought the burning torch close to the milkbowl, above which millions of flies, mosquitoes and gnats circled about,
CJ|0|223|16|0|he there discovered a long shimmering tail consisting of the flying insects which was several fathoms long,
CJ|0|223|17|0|and of which the milkbowl formed the head.
CJ|0|223|18|0|This phenomenon was also seen by many other people,
CJ|0|223|19|0|and all were amazed at the similarity of this effected appearance with the comet in the sky.
CJ|0|223|20|0|Hereupon Jonathan went over to the little Child and asked Him how he was to understand this.
CJ|0|223|21|0|And the little Child answered, 'For the time being just as you have seen it! Not everyone may know this secret,
CJ|0|223|22|0|so be satisfied with that for now. Tomorrow will be another day.'
CJ|0|224|1|1|The Nature Of A Comet
CJ|0|224|1|0|JONATHAN BEGAN to rack his brain at this but was totally unable to take hold of a sensible thought.
CJ|0|224|2|0|The little Child naturally noticed at once that Jonathan was unable to bring the milkbowl comet into harmony with the heavenly comet.
CJ|0|224|3|0|He therefore sat up and said to Jonathan,
CJ|0|224|4|0|'My dear Jonathan! See, your thoughts are like an image of the milkbowl comet which you saw.
CJ|0|224|5|0|Your heart represents the large bowl filled with milk, in which your love is the milk.
CJ|0|224|6|0|But above your heart there now is also an enormous swarm of midges, bugs and gnats, just like the one above the milkbowl.
CJ|0|224|7|0|And this swarm consists of your thoughts which border on the ridiculous concerning the similar nature of the two comets.
CJ|0|224|8|0|Now friend Jonathan, who ever would seriously consider the core of the heavenly comet to be a milkbowl and its tail to be a swarm of bugs?
CJ|0|224|9|0|Those are after all only representations, but not perfect likenesses in nature!
CJ|0|224|10|0|'Now do you really know what a representation is? - What is represented by the bowl? Or by the milk therein? Or by the swarm of bugs and gnats?
CJ|0|224|11|0|See, you do not understand that; so listen and I will tell you something about it.
CJ|0|224|12|0|The bowl represents a vessel used to hold substances to which My sustaining power of life is held fast;
CJ|0|224|13|0|and the milk is such a substance which carries My sustaining power of life in most bounteous measure.
CJ|0|224|14|0|In the midges, bugs and gnats the power of life is already freely active -
CJ|0|224|15|0|but if it is not nurtured with a proper sustaining power of life, it soon becomes weak and cannot develop itself for a higher and more perfect state of existence.
CJ|0|224|16|0|'And behold, the heavenly comet is nothing else than a newly created, becoming world!
CJ|0|224|17|0|The core is the vessel which holds My sustaining power of life.
CJ|0|224|18|0|This power of life is very strongly heated by its own inherent fire which I have given into this same power of life, and thus dissolves itself into nourishing vapors.
CJ|0|224|19|0|And so these vapors carrying a more advanced power of life do not evanesce and become lost to the new world,
CJ|0|224|20|0|they then are taken up by myriads of monads (amoeboids inhabiting the ether) and by them again carried to the newly-becoming world toward its more complete development.
CJ|0|224|21|0|See, that is the corresponding similarity between the heavenly comet and our milkbowl comet!
CJ|0|224|22|0|'Do not search any father now, so your love will not be weakened because of your searching!'
CJ|0|224|23|0|This explanation was heard by quite a few, and while no one understood it, many believed it.
CJ|0|225|1|1|The Long and Short Approach To God
CJ|0|225|1|0|CYRENIUS NOW ASKED the little Child, saying, 'O my life, why may or why should one not search more deeply into Your works?
CJ|0|225|2|0|Why did You declare such searching to be detrimental to one's love for You?
CJ|0|225|3|0|I would say it is just the opposite: Once one gets to know Your works in ever greater depth and clarity, one must obviously increase in love toward You and not become weaker therein!
CJ|0|225|4|0|For it is already the case even among us humans that a man also becomes all the more dear to us the more perfections we discover in him.
CJ|0|225|5|0|'How much more then will that be the case with You, the Lord and Creator of all things great, perfect and glorious if we learn to know You ever more and more!
CJ|0|225|6|0|Therefore I would really like to entreat You myself, o my life, that You would give me a bit more enlightenment concerning this unusual star.
CJ|0|225|7|0|For my heart tells me that I will be able to love You quite completely only then, when I am able to recognize You more and more completely in Your almighty, truly wise and wondrous works.
CJ|0|225|8|0|No one can really love You as the only Lord and God if he does not know You before that.
CJ|0|225|9|0|Thus our knowing in our souls who You are is in fact the chief reason of our love for You,
CJ|0|225|10|0|just as I also first had to become acquainted with my wife before I could take her into my heart. If I had not come to know her, she surely would not have become my wife.'
CJ|0|225|11|0|Here the little Child smiled and replied, 'Oh My dear Cyrenius, if you were to give Me such wise instruction more often, I would surely become a thoroughly shrewd human being also!
CJ|0|225|12|0|See, you have really told Me lots of new things here.
CJ|0|225|13|0|But consider this: Just now you were a teacher to Me, for you tried to prove to Me that My warning in regard to overmuch searching in My works as being detrimental for the soul of man in the realm of his love toward Me did not apply - and that, on the contrary, such searching is the proper way.
CJ|0|225|14|0|How then should I, as your pupil, instruct you in matters still unknown to you?
CJ|0|225|15|0|If there are better grounds for love known to you than your God and Creator gives you, how then can you entreat Him for more profound enlightenment?
CJ|0|225|16|0|Or do you really suppose that God will allow Himself to be swayed to do something by reasonings arrived at and presented by men as if He were a judge according to worldly law?
CJ|0|225|17|0|Oh Cyrenius, therein you are still in very great error!
CJ|0|225|18|0|'See, I alone know My eternal order which is the mother of all things!
CJ|0|225|19|0|Out of this order you too have gone forth! The love of your spirit toward Me is your very own life!
CJ|0|225|20|0|Now if you want to turn this love away from Me all the more, when in fact you have Me right before your eyes in the flesh,
CJ|0|225|21|0|say, will such a foolish increase in your love really be justified?
CJ|0|225|22|0|'Yes, he who still does not know Me nor has Me in his heart, he may indeed attain Me in the manner you advocate -
CJ|0|225|23|0|but if someone already has Me on his lap, to what end should your gradual degrees of approach serve him?'
CJ|0|225|24|0|At this Cyrenius was greatly taken aback, took the matter deeply to heart, and no one asked about the comet any more.
CJ|0|226|1|1|Never Fear The World - But Fear Yourselves
CJ|0|226|1|0|WHEN THE MATTER of the comet was thus disposed of, the little Child said to Joseph,
CJ|0|226|2|0|'Joseph, throughout these two days I took charge as an undisputed master of the house and all of you obeyed Me -
CJ|0|226|3|0|but from now on I am returning the mastery of the house back to you, and as you decide matters, so also shall they be done!
CJ|0|226|4|0|'From now on I am going to be like every other human being again and must be that way, for My flesh must also grow for the sake of all your welfare.
CJ|0|226|5|0|For that reason do not now nor in the future expect any more openly manifest wonders from Me in this country!
CJ|0|226|6|0|But for all that do not allow yourselves to be deceived in your faith and reliance in My power and might,
CJ|0|226|7|0|for What I was from eternity, That I am always and will be for eternity.
CJ|0|226|8|0|'Hence, never fear the world which is nothing before Me - but fear yourselves, lest you turn your hearts away from Me - for that would be the death of your soul!
CJ|0|226|9|0|With that you, Joseph, may again take over the management of the house, and lead it justly and properly in the name of My Father, Amen!
CJ|0|226|10|0|And you, Cyrenius, depart tomorrow on a safe journey for Tyre, where important matters already await you.
CJ|0|226|11|0|My love and My grace are with you so you need not worry. Arrange all other matters with Joseph, for he is now the head of the house.'
CJ|0|226|12|0|Thereupon the little Child called James over to Himself and said to him,
CJ|0|226|13|0|'James, between us the first relationship will remain with which you are familiar.
CJ|0|226|14|0|Now all this must be adhered to in this land, Amen!' -
CJ|0|226|15|0|At this Joseph became quite sad and earnestly pleaded with the little Child to continue as at present in His divine nature.
CJ|0|226|16|0|But the little Child now talked quite childishly, and no trace of anything divine remained in His speech.
CJ|0|226|17|0|He soon became sleepy, and James had to bring Him to bed.
CJ|0|226|18|0|Long into the night the company sat together and discussed the possible reason for such change in the little Child.
CJ|0|226|19|0|No one said anything conclusive and each asked of the other -
CJ|0|226|20|0|but none was able to give a definite answer.
CJ|0|226|21|0|And Joseph finally said, 'We know what is good for us and what we should do, and that ought to satisfy us!
CJ|0|226|22|0|It is already late at night - so I think it is best that we retire.'
CJ|0|226|23|0|In this all agreed with Joseph and promptly went into the house to a good night's rest.
CJ|0|227|1|1|The Generosity Of Jonathan
CJ|0|227|1|0|THE FOLLOWING DAY JOSEPH, as usual, was up much earlier than anyone else and went outside to see what sort of a day was in the offing.
CJ|0|227|2|0|He found all the signs for a beautiful day, then returned into the house and awakened his sons so they might prepare a good breakfast for the guests.
CJ|0|227|3|0|The sons soon arose and went to see what provisions the larder might still contain.
CJ|0|227|4|0|When they had searched through the larder, they promptly came to Joseph and said,
CJ|0|227|5|0|'Listen, dear father, your request would be easy enough to fulfill,
CJ|0|227|6|0|but our larder has been so greatly depleted these last few days that it is just impossible for us to scrape together a meal for even ten persons.
CJ|0|227|7|0|So advise us whence we are to take the foodstuffs, and the meal shall be ready in one hour.'
CJ|0|227|8|0|Here Joseph scratched himself a bit behind the ears, then went into the larder himself and there found the assertions of his sons confirmed, which disconcerted him all the more.
CJ|0|227|9|0|He thought back and forth but could not think of anything that might help him out Of his predicament.
CJ|0|227|10|0|Now as Joseph stood there in the entrance hall considering what to do next, Jonathan came out of his sleeping chamber, greeted and kissed his old friend and asked him why he stood there so unhappily and thoughtfully.
CJ|0|227|11|0|And Joseph promptly showed Jonathan the cause of this perplexity, namely the empty larder.
CJ|0|227|12|0|When Jonathan beheld this, he said to Joseph,
CJ|0|227|13|0|'Oh my very dear friend, that need not concern you at all.
CJ|0|227|14|0|See, my larders are still quite full - I still have about two thousand hundredweights of smoked fish.
CJ|0|227|15|0|So have your sons come with me right away, and in an hour and a half your larder will be well stocked!'
CJ|0|227|16|0|This offer acted as a true balm upon Joseph's heart and he quickly accepted it.
CJ|0|227|17|0|Hardly an hour and a half passed, when Jonathan and the four sons already returned with a heavy load of fish.
CJ|0|227|18|0|The sons brought about four hundredweights of smoked fish, and Jonathan brought three large casks filled with fresh fish and ten large loaves of wheat bread.
CJ|0|227|19|0|When Joseph saw the arrivals thus burdened, he was full of joy and thanked and praised God for such a gift and then embraced and kissed Jonathan.
CJ|0|227|20|0|Thereupon the kitchen soon teemed with activity.
CJ|0|227|21|0|The sons busied themselves in a lively manner, while Mary and Eudokia soon came from their sleeping chamber, wasted no time and milked the cows.
CJ|0|227|22|0|Thus a plentiful breakfast was quickly prepared in an hour for more than a hundred guests.
CJ|0|228|1|1|The Difference Between God's True And False Servants
CJ|0|228|1|0|WHEN THE MORNING MEAL was thus prepared and all the guests had arisen, Joseph promptly went to Cyrenius and asked him if he were ready to partake of the morning meal.
CJ|0|228|2|0|And Cyrenius said to Joseph, 'Oh my truly noble friend and brother, I am of course quite ready with my entire company;
CJ|0|228|3|0|but I also know that you do not have such a supply in your larder that you can accommodate over a hundred people for several days.
CJ|0|228|4|0|Therefore I shall send my servants to the city this morning, where they shall buy foodstuffs for me and for you."
CJ|0|228|5|0|When Joseph heard this, he replied,
CJ|0|228|6|0|'Oh dear friend and brother, that you can of course do for your ship;
CJ|0|228|7|0|but in my case you would go to a lot of trouble for nothing.
CJ|0|228|8|0|You see, in the first place the morning meal is already prepared, and secondly there still is so much left in my larder that all those here could hardly eat it up in eight days.
CJ|0|228|9|0|So do not concern yourself for me of all people - for truly, I am indeed well supplied.'1
CJ|0|228|10|0|And Cyrenius affirmed, 'Truly, truly, if nothing else were to give me witness of your most high calling, it would be given me in fullest measure by your quite incomprehensible unselfishness.
CJ|0|228|11|0|'Yes, therein one will always be able to accurately tell the true servants of God from the false:
CJ|0|228|12|0|The true ones will be unselfish to a high degree, and the false ones will be just the opposite;
CJ|0|228|13|0|for the true ones serve the Lord in their heart and there also have a most high, eternal reward -
CJ|0|228|14|0|but the false ones serve a God modeled after their own bad kind, for the sake of the world -
CJ|0|228|15|0|hence they also seek the reward of the world and allow themselves to be paid extravagantly for every step they take.
CJ|0|228|16|0|For I as a born pagan know best, how the Roman priests allow themselves to be paid for each and every step.
CJ|0|228|17|0|Truly, I myself once had to pay the chief priest a hundred pounds of gold for some advice.
CJ|0|228|18|0|I ask: Was that a fitting servant of a true God?
CJ|0|228|19|0|'But you have now shown me your hospitality for three days, and what teachings I have received in your house - and still you accept nothing.
CJ|0|228|20|0|Not even for my eight children will you accept anything. - From that it certainly should be clear how the real and true servants of God appear.'
CJ|0|228|21|0|Here Joseph said, 'Brother, do not say any more about that now, for such talk praises me too much;
CJ|0|228|22|0|but sit down at the table, and the morning meal will be served right away.' And Cyrenius promptly followed Joseph's wish and sat down at the table.
CJ|0|229|1|1|A Memorable Morning Meal For Cyrenius
CJ|0|229|1|0|WHEN EVERYONE WAS at the table, quite tastily prepared fish were quickly served,
CJ|0|229|2|0|and Cyrenius was greatly surprised that it had been possible for Joseph to obtain such a quantity of quite fresh fish so early in the morning.
CJ|0|229|3|0|Hereupon Joseph pointed to the huge Jonathan and remarked somewhat jokingly,
CJ|0|229|4|0|'See, when one has such a great fishing expert for a friend, one need not reach too far - and the fish are there.'
CJ|0|229|5|0|At this Cyrenius smiled and agreed, 'Yes, you are indeed right.
CJ|0|229|6|0|Truly, under such circumstances one can always have fresh fish, and that especially if one also has Someone in his house.'
CJ|0|229|7|0|Hereupon Joseph lifted up his hands and fervently stated,
CJ|0|229|8|0|'Yes, brother Cyrenius, especially Someone of whom we all will eternally never be worthy.
CJ|0|229|9|0|May He bless this good morning meal for all of us, that it truly may strengthen us in our limbs and in our love to Him, the most Holy!'
CJ|0|229|10|0|This exclamation of Joseph brought all the guests to tears, and all praised the great God in the still sleeping little Child.
CJ|0|229|11|0|When the guests were done with their praise and began to eat of the fish, the little Child also awakened,
CJ|0|229|12|0|and the good smell of the fish immediately told Him what was on the table.
CJ|0|229|13|0|Hence He quickly got out of His low little bed, promptly ran over to the table quite naked to where Mary was and requested something to eat.
CJ|0|229|14|0|Here Mary promptly took Him on her lap and said to James,
CJ|0|229|15|0|'Go quickly and bring me a little shirt out of the side room.'
CJ|0|229|16|0|And James quickly followed Mary's wish and brought a clean little shirt.
CJ|0|229|17|0|But this time the little Child would not allow the little shirt to be put on Him.
CJ|0|229|18|0|At this Mary became somewhat impatient and scolded, 'See, my little Child, it just is not proper to be naked at the table;
CJ|0|229|19|0|therefore I shall be quite severe if You do not allow Yourself to be dressed!'
CJ|0|229|20|0|Cyrenius, wholly moved to tears at the sight of the tender little Boy, said to Mary,
CJ|0|229|21|0|'Oh dear, most charming mother, give me the little Boy, so I may once more thus quite naked fondle and caress Him!
CJ|0|229|22|0|Who knows whether this infinitely great good fortune will come my way again in this world?'
CJ|0|229|23|0|Here the little Child smiled at Cyrenius and immediately wanted to go to him.
CJ|0|229|24|0|And Mary promptly gave Him over to Cyrenius, and he wept from joy and bliss as the healthy little Boy frolicked on his lap in a lively way.
CJ|0|229|25|0|Hereupon Cyrenius asked Him which piece of the fish He would like to eat.
CJ|0|229|26|0|And the little Child said in a wholly childlike manner, 'Give Me that white piece which has no fish-bone in it!'
CJ|0|229|27|0|And Cyrenius quickly handed the little Child the best and whitest piece which He ate happily and leisurely.
CJ|0|229|28|0|After He had satisfied His hunger, He stated, 'That was good! Now you dress Me!
CJ|0|229|29|0|For when I am hungry, I want to eat first and only then wear a garment!' - Thereupon the little Child said no more and serenely let Cyrenius dress Him with the little shirt.
CJ|0|230|1|1|Mary's Strictness A Symbol Of Her Motherly Love
CJ|0|230|1|0|WHEN THE LITTLE CHILD was dressed, Cyrenius asked Him again if He would not like to have another tasty little piece of the fish.
CJ|0|230|2|0|Here the little Child said after His manner, 'I really would like another small piece -
CJ|0|230|3|0|but I dare not accept it because mother would promptly scold Me again.'
CJ|0|230|4|0|And Cyrenius said assuringly, 'O my dearly beloved little Child, if I give it to You, your mother will say nothing.'
CJ|0|230|5|0|To this the little Child responded quite naively, 'Yes, as long as you are here she will of course say nothing;
CJ|0|230|6|0|but once you are gone I will be in for it twice as bad.
CJ|0|230|7|0|Oh you just would not believe how cross My mother can be when I do something that she does not like!'
CJ|0|230|8|0|Cyrenius smiled thereto and then asked the little Child, 'What would You say, if I were to scold Your somewhat strict mother for that - would that not make her more lenient toward You?'
CJ|0|230|9|0|And the little Child objected, 'I beg you, do anything but that - for once you were gone I would really get a dressing down the like of which has not been heard!'
CJ|0|230|10|0|Here Cyrenius continued to ask the little Child and said,
CJ|0|230|11|0|'O my life, my heavenly little Child, if Your mother is so strict, how can You still love her so very much?'
CJ|0|230|12|0|And the little Child answered, 'Because she is strict out of her great love to Me - for she constantly has the greatest fear that some sort of harm might befall Me.
CJ|0|230|13|0|So you see, that is why I am bound to love her very much in return! Even if she is sometimes cross without cause - she still means well and for that she surely deserves My love.
CJ|0|230|14|0|See, for just that reason she would also be cross now if I were to eat another little piece of fish, because she thinks it could do Me harm.
CJ|0|230|15|0|It would of course do Me no harm, but I do not want to sin against the good intentions of My mother.
CJ|0|230|16|0|Oh, I can deny Myself also and can keep My mother's orders when it has to be that way,
CJ|0|230|17|0|but when her order does not have to be strictly adhered to, I can also do as I please.
CJ|0|230|18|0|And then I do not let it bother Me even though mother scolds a bit.
CJ|0|230|19|0|It is not really necessary now that I should eat another piece of fish; hence I will also deny Myself so mother can have nothing against Me when you are gone.'
CJ|0|230|20|0|Here Cyrenius again spoke to the little Child and inquired in a very loving manner,
CJ|0|230|21|0|'Yes, my life, but if you already have such respect of Your earthly mother, why did You not allow Yourself to be dressed by her a little while ago?
CJ|0|230|22|0|Will she not scold You for that once I am gone?'
CJ|0|230|23|0|And the little Child affirmed, 'No doubt - but I shall not let .it bother Me much!
CJ|0|230|24|0|For I already told you before that I sometimes do as I please, and do not ask whether My mother agrees with it or not.
CJ|0|230|25|0|But for all that My mother can still scold Me, for she has a good intention and a good will thereby.'
CJ|0|230|26|0|At this Mary smiled and said jokingly, 'Now You just wait until we are alone,
CJ|0|230|27|0|and I shall really scold You again because You have now complained against me so to Cyrenius!'
CJ|0|230|28|0|Hereupon the little Child smiled and replied, 'Oh, you do not mean that. I can easily tell when you are really cross, for then you are quite red in the face - but now you are nice and white like I am, and then you are never upset!'
CJ|0|230|29|0|All laughed at this remark, and the little Child also smiled. And Mary in her ardor took the little Child and caressed Him fervently.
CJ|0|231|1|1|Cyrenius Provides For Joseph's House
CJ|0|231|1|0|FOLLOWING THIS CHILDLY INTERLUDE the morning meal was completed.
CJ|0|231|2|0|And when Joseph finished with the prayer of thanksgiving, Cyrenius went over to him and said,
CJ|0|231|3|0|'My dearest friend, your services to me as well as to my brother Julius Augustus Quirinus Caesar in Rome are of such an outstanding nature that I shall never be able to recompense you therefor.
CJ|0|231|4|0|But to leave you altogether unrewarded - that is utterly impossible to me!
CJ|0|231|5|0|'Now I know that you will not accept a kingly reward from me,
CJ|0|231|6|0|so I have decided on the following: this year, as is evident, you can expect a poor harvest in grain,
CJ|0|231|7|0|when after all your house has quite a number of dwellers.
CJ|0|231|8|0|Besides, nine of them belong to me, and you and yours also total eight; so there are altogether seventeen.
CJ|0|231|9|0|Now I know in my soul that your flour bins are empty and also your larder,
CJ|0|231|10|0|and that you are already running short of feed for your cows, goats and donkeys.
CJ|0|231|11|0|See, all of that I know very well - as I also know that you and yours have almost nothing more to wear.
CJ|0|231|12|0|Therefore, my dearest brother, you must at least accept enough from me to fill your needs for the present.
CJ|0|231|13|0|'I am of course well aware that it would be extremely ridiculous for a man of the earth to undertake to support the Lord of creation, for whom it is an easy thing to create myriads of worlds with one word.
CJ|0|231|14|0|But I also know that this selfsame holy Lord of creation does not wish to constantly effect wonders contrary to His eternal wondrous order, because a judgment is always connected with that for us, His creatures.
CJ|0|231|15|0|For that reason you must accept what you need this time at least,
CJ|0|231|16|0|and not refuse me as you usually do!'
CJ|0|231|17|0|And Joseph replied, 'Yes brother, this time you are probably right -
CJ|0|231|18|0|but before I accept anything from you I still must ask the Lord.'
CJ|0|231|19|0|Here the little Child, who was now with James, came over quickly and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|231|20|0|'Joseph, go ahead and accept what Cyrenius wants to give you, so you may supply the house with foodstuffs.'
CJ|0|231|21|0|At this Joseph accepted the offer of Cyrenius,
CJ|0|231|22|0|whereupon the latter promptly gave Joseph a sum of a thousand pounds of silver and seventy pounds of gold,
CJ|0|231|23|0|for which Joseph tendered Cyrenius his thanks and took the heavy sum.
CJ|0|231|24|0|Thereupon Cyrenius was overjoyed and affirmed, 'Brother, now my heart is a thousand times lighter! I am not leaving here today but only tomorrow, for my too great love will not let me go.' And Joseph was made very happy thereby.
CJ|0|232|1|1|On The Burden Of Money
CJ|0|232|1|0|NOW JOSEPH had no trunk wherein he might put the money.
CJ|0|232|2|0|At this Cyrenius at once ordered his servants to go into the city and buy a chest there at whatever cost necessary.
CJ|0|232|3|0|And the servants went at once and in the short space of two hours brought an elegant cedar chest which had cost ten pounds of silver.
CJ|0|232|4|0|This chest was then placed in Joseph's bedchamber, and Joseph's sons laid the large and heavy amount of money into the ornate and heavy chest.
CJ|0|232|5|0|When the money was thus put away, Joseph said,
CJ|0|232|6|0|'Now I am - from a worldly standpoint - rich for the first time in my whole life,
CJ|0|232|7|0|for I have never seen and all the less owned so much money!
CJ|0|232|8|0|Until now my house knew nothing of a thief and still less of a robber,
CJ|0|232|9|0|but from now on all of us will not have sufficient eyes and time to protect this money from thieves and robbers.'
CJ|0|232|10|0|Here Jonathan observed, 'Brother, never mind about that!
CJ|0|232|11|0|I know only too well whom the robbers and thieves seek out.
CJ|0|232|12|0|See, they seek out only those who are mean and stingy.
CJ|0|232|13|0|And that certainly does not apply to you, so you need not be concerned - for everyone who asks anything of you receives three times more from you anyway than what he asks for.
CJ|0|232|14|0|Therefore I would say that you will no doubt have to deal with a lot of beggars, but certainly not with thieves and robbers.'
CJ|0|232|15|0|Here Mary also came over and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|232|16|0|'Listen, dear father, you know that while in the city of our father David we also received a great burden of gold from the three wise men of the East who came from Persia;
CJ|0|232|17|0|and behold, now we do not have any of it even the size of a grain of sand, although we were never robbed of it!
CJ|0|232|18|0|So I would say that it will be the same with us here: not a year will pass, and we will have nothing left of it without thieves and robbers.
CJ|0|232|19|0|So just do not worry; for in a house where the Lord dwells, gold has no standing and the robbers and thieves just do not want to have much to do in the Lord's house!
CJ|0|232|20|0|For they know as well as I and you that it is tempting the super-natural to lay violent hands on treasures which lie as it were in God's poor-box.'
CJ|0|232|21|0|When Mary finished, the little Child also came over and said,
CJ|0|232|22|0|'Joseph, you faithful man, you must not look so fearfully at yonder chest in which My brothers have laid the money.
CJ|0|232|23|0|For when you look so apprehensive, I get the impression that you are sick.
CJ|0|232|24|0|Now see, I do not want you to be sick.
CJ|0|232|25|0|This money will not burden you for any length of time at all. Buy quite a lot of flour now and other foodstuffs and some clothing, and distribute the rest among the poor,
CJ|0|232|26|0|and the chest will be empty again in short order.' - These childlike words becalmed Joseph so greatly that he was promptly full of good cheer.
CJ|0|233|1|1|Jonathan Fells A Mighty Tree
CJ|0|233|1|0|JOSEPH NOW called the four sons over and said to them,
CJ|0|233|2|0|'Here, take this pound of silver and go into the city to buy flour and whatever else is still needed for the kitchen,
CJ|0|233|3|0|and then come and prepare a good midday meal, since Cyrenius still honors me with his presence today.'
CJ|0|233|4|0|At this the sons promptly went and carried out their father's wishes.
CJ|0|233|5|0|Then Mary also came over and privately told Joseph that the supply of firewood was also so greatly depleted that it would hardly be possible to prepare a meal with the little that still remained.
CJ|0|233|6|0|Here Joseph called Jonathan over and told him of this difficulty.
CJ|0|233|7|0|And Jonathan declared, 'Brother, give me your large and strong axe, and I shall go into the forest over there by the hill;
CJ|0|233|8|0|and truly, in three hours you shall have wood aplenty.'
CJ|0|233|9|0|Here Joseph gave Jonathan a strong axe, whereupon the latter went into the woods of the nearest hill, which belonged to the villa, and there quickly chopped down a strong cedar, fastened a strong rope around the trunk and thus pulled the whole mighty tree in front of Joseph's house.
CJ|0|233|10|0|When he arrived there with his felled tree, all were astonished at the enormous strength of Jonathan.
CJ|0|233|11|0|Many servants of Cyrenius together now attempted to pull the tree farther but their efforts were in vain,
CJ|0|233|12|0|for they, numbering about thirty, were not able to move the tree even a hairbreadth, since it weighed about one hundred hundredweights.
CJ|0|233|13|0|At this Jonathan said to the servants of Cyrenius,
CJ|0|233|14|0|'Instead of this vain attempt, just take big and little axes in hand and help me to quickly split up the tree!
CJ|0|233|15|0|This effort will please the head of the house more than if you try to measure my enormous strength on this tree by your vain effort.
CJ|0|233|16|0|Here all the servants of Cyrenius promptly lent a hand, and with the energetic assistance of Jonathan the whole tree was cut up in half an hour.
CJ|0|233|17|0|Joseph was full of joy at this and asserted,
CJ|0|233|18|0|'Truly, that would have been three days' work for me until I could have cut up such a tree,
CJ|0|233|19|0|and you needed hardly three hours altogether.'
CJ|0|233|20|0|And Jonathan retorted, 'Oh brother, great bodily strength is no doubt a useful thing;
CJ|0|233|21|0|but what is it against the strength of Him who lives with you and before whose breath the whole creation trembles?'
CJ|0|233|22|0|Here the little Child came over to Jonathan and said to him, 'Be still, Jonathan, and do not betray Me; for I know when I must reveal Myself!
CJ|0|233|23|0|And if My power had not been with you now, you could neither have mastered this tree. - But be still and say nothing about it!' - Here Jonathan said no more and only now understood how he had so easily mastered this tree.
CJ|0|234|1|1|A Glittering Deputation Arrives From Ostracine
CJ|0|234|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH'S HOUSE was thus supplied with wood, and the sons of Joseph quite industriously began to prepare the noon meal,
CJ|0|234|2|0|a deputation of very prominent citizens arrived in full regalia from the city to greet the supreme governor.
CJ|0|234|3|0|For while no one in the city had heard anything this time concerning the presence of Cyrenius because he wished to be there in strictest incognito,
CJ|0|234|4|0|the well-known household servants as well as the sons of Joseph were seen in the city that morning, and the presence of the governor was thus surmised.
CJ|0|234|5|0|Therefore the leading citizens gathered in the city and came out in full splendor, which visit was most inopportune to Cyrenius on this occasion.
CJ|0|234|6|0|The garrison commander and the from previous pages familiar captain were of course at the head of the large deputation from the city of Ostracine.
CJ|0|234|7|0|The commander apologized profusely that he had ascertained so late, and then only by lucky chance, that his imperial, consular highness was gracing this area with his exalted presence.
CJ|0|234|8|0|And Cyrenius nearly turned away in his secret annoyance at this for him most untimely visit.
CJ|0|234|9|0|But for all that he now responded in a pleasant manner for the sake of political expediency and answered the greeter in equally polite words.
CJ|0|234|10|0|But after a while he unburdened himself to the garrison commander, saying, 'My friend, we prominent lords of the world sometimes fare quite badly.
CJ|0|234|11|0|A common man can go where he pleases and remain in sweet incognito;
CJ|0|234|12|0|but we need only to go a little beyond our doorstep and our incognito is already gone with the wind!
CJ|0|234|13|0|I do of course accept your stately greeting in the name of my brother with heartfelt appreciation;
CJ|0|234|14|0|but it has to remain that I am here in strictest incognito,
CJ|0|234|15|0|which means in other words: This my presence here is unofficial and may under no circumstances be reported to Rome.
CJ|0|234|16|0|If I were to find out that someone had dared to submit such a report to Rome, he will surely regret it! - For mark it well, I am here in strictest incognito for the world!
CJ|0|234|17|0|Why? I know why, and no one is to ask me about it.
CJ|0|234|18|0|Go to your homes now and put on ordinary clothing, and then return for the midday meal, which will take place about three hours before sunset.'
CJ|0|234|19|0|Here the deputation bowed before the governor and departed.
CJ|0|234|20|0|Thereupon Joseph went over to Cyrenius and said,
CJ|0|234|21|0|'See, that is already the first result of the money which you gave me in such bounteous measure.
CJ|0|234|22|0|Your household servants had to buy me a chest for it, were then recognized - and your presence betrayed.
CJ|0|234|23|0|As I have always said: Gold and silver still bear the old curse of God!'
CJ|0|234|24|0|To this the little Child, who was right at Joseph's side, added smilingly,
CJ|0|234|25|0|'Therefore one can subject the proud gold and the vain silver to no greater humiliation than to distribute it in just measure among the poor.
CJ|0|234|26|0|Now you, My dear Joseph, do that all the time; therefore the old curse will do you little harm and the same to Cyrenius also.
CJ|0|234|27|0|Oh, I am not a bit concerned over this gold; for here it is already in the right place.'
CJ|0|234|28|0|These words again put Joseph as well as Cyrenius at their ease and they now awaited the invited guests in very good spirits.
CJ|0|235|1|1|O You Disgraceful Bourn Of Earth
CJ|0|235|1|0|AT THE PREARRANGED TIME the deputation returned from the city in different attire, greeted everyone in Joseph's house and then went with Cyrenius to the already prepared meal.
CJ|0|235|2|0|But since more unexpected guests were now gathered than had been anticipated, it was found that Joseph's table was too little to accommodate his family also.
CJ|0|235|3|0|At this the little Child privately advised Joseph, 'Father Joseph, have a little table set up for us in the adjoining side-room.
CJ|0|235|4|0|And tell Cyrenius not to feel hurt on that account,
CJ|0|235|5|0|since I shall surely come to him again after the meal.'
CJ|0|235|6|0|And Joseph thereupon did as the little Child had advised him.
CJ|0|235|7|0|Here Cyrenius objected, 'That will never do! If the Lord of creation is among us, we certainly are not going to put Him in a corner at a table with the cats.
CJ|0|235|8|0|Oh, that would surely be the most inappropriate arrangement on earth!
CJ|0|235|9|0|I tell you, none other than He and you must sit at the head.'
CJ|0|235|10|0|And Joseph replied, 'My very dear brother, that really will not do this time;
CJ|0|235|11|0|for there are many pagans here from the city, and for them the too great nearness of the Lord could have bad consequences - so the little Child's will should be respected here as it is everywhere and always!'
CJ|0|235|12|0|And the little Child also came over and said, 'Cyrenius, Joseph is quite right, just follow his words.'
CJ|0|235|13|0|Here Cyrenius objected no more and immediately went to the midday meal with his company and the deputation from the city.
CJ|0|235|14|0|Thereupon Joseph quickly had a sturdy table placed in the adjoining room, at which he, Mary, the little Child and His James,
CJ|0|235|15|0|Jonathan, Eudokia and the eight children of Cyrenius took place.
CJ|0|235|16|0|Naturally the foods of lesser quantity and quality were served at the table at which Joseph, Mary, the little Child and His James sat, while the most and better foods came to the table of the guests.
CJ|0|235|17|0|And the little Child declared, 'O you disgraceful bourn of earth, must you bring forth that which is most wretched for none other than your own Lord?
CJ|0|235|18|0|O you now fruitful land between Asia and Africa, for that you shall be smitten for all time with great unfruitfulness!
CJ|0|235|19|0|In very truth, if our table did not have a few fish, there just would be nothing of which I can partake!
CJ|0|235|20|0|Here is a cooked milk dish with a little honey, which I do not like, and there a fried sea-onion, and there a small melon, and there some stale bread, and beside it a little butter and honey.
CJ|0|235|21|0|That is our whole meal - nothing but foods which I do not like, with the exception of the few fish.
CJ|0|235|22|0|Now I do not want that the guests should be worse off than we;
CJ|0|235|23|0|but it certainly is not right either that we should be a lot worse off than the guests.'
CJ|0|235|24|0|Here Joseph said, 'Oh dear Jesus, do not be annoyed, for You see that we all fare the same!'
CJ|0|235|25|0|And the little Child replied, 'Give Me of the fish, and that will do for now. But another time things will have to be different, for I cannot always be satisfied with such poor fare!' - Joseph remembered this and gave the little Child to eat of the fish.
CJ|0|236|1|1|The Humility Of The Lord
CJ|0|236|1|0|NOW WHILE HE ATE of the fish, the little Child asked Jonathan, 'Can that be the best sort of fish?
CJ|0|236|2|0|For I tell you that this fish does not taste good to Me at all!
CJ|0|236|3|0|In the first place it is tough and then as dry as straw.
CJ|0|236|4|0|Truly, that cannot be a good sort of fish, which is also evident by its many troublesome fish-bones.'
CJ|0|236|5|0|And Jonathan answered, 'Yes, My Lord and my God! It is truly the sort of the lowest quality!
CJ|0|236|6|0|Oh if Joseph had only said something to me sooner, I certainly would have gladly run back and forth ten times more and would have brought You the very best fish!'
CJ|0|236|7|0|Hereupon Joseph became irritated with his sons because they had taken such poor care of his table.
CJ|0|236|8|0|But the little Child said, 'We must not exactly become irritated on account of that;
CJ|0|236|9|0|but it does always seem strange of My brothers that they keep the best in the kitchen to themselves, and actually serve us the worst of everything.
CJ|0|236|10|0|As far as that goes may everything be blessed for them; but it is not considerate or praiseworthy of them.
CJ|0|236|11|0|See, you have really given Me the best piece of the fish; but I just cannot eat it all although I am still quite hungry -
CJ|0|236|12|0|and that is a sure sign that the fish is bad.
CJ|0|236|13|0|Here, taste this little piece, and you will be convinced that I am right!'
CJ|0|236|14|0|Here Joseph tasted the fish and found the assertion of the little Child fully confirmed.
CJ|0|236|15|0|At this he promptly stood up and went into the kitchen where he found that the four sons were eating a tuna of the best sort.
CJ|0|236|16|0|Thereat Joseph lost his patience, and he began to give the four sons a thorough dressing-down.
CJ|0|236|17|0|But the sons objected, saying, 'Father, we have to do all the hard work - why then should we not eat a better morsel once in a while than those who do not work?
CJ|0|236|18|0|Besides, the fish which we have given for your table certainly is not bad,
CJ|0|236|19|0|but the little Child is sometimes just too full of caprice because He has been spoiled by you, and then nothing is right or good enough for Him!'
CJ|0|236|20|0|This made Joseph angry and he declared, 'Good, because you answer me with such speech, you shall never prepare food for my table again!
CJ|0|236|21|0|Mary will be my cook from now on, and you may cook for yourselves what you will; but none of you shall ever be seen again at my table!'
CJ|0|236|22|0|Joseph then left the four sons and in quite an aroused frame of mind returned to his table through a little side door.
CJ|0|236|23|0|Hereupon the little Child became sad and began to weep and sob unrestrainedly.
CJ|0|236|24|0|At this Mary, Joseph and James immediately asked Him with worried expressions what was the matter with Him, whether He felt any pain -
CJ|0|236|25|0|or what it might be that all of a sudden caused Him to become so sad and distressed?
CJ|0|236|26|0|And the little Child sighed deeply and said to Joseph in a very melancholy tone,
CJ|0|236|27|0|'Joseph, is it really so sweet to show the poor and the weak one's authority and to condemn them for a minor offence?
CJ|0|236|28|0|Just look at Me for once, how many ever so miserably poor cooks do I have in the world who would long ago have let Me, the Father of fathers, starve to death if it were possible to do that with Me!
CJ|0|236|29|0|I tell you, cooks who have forgotten that I exist, and who do not want to hear or know anything about Me!
CJ|0|236|30|0|And behold, I nevertheless do not go out so I may judge them in My just anger!
CJ|0|236|31|0|'Is it really so sweet to be a ruler? See, I am the only Lord of infinity, and beside Me there is eternally no other!
CJ|0|236|32|0|And behold I, the Creator and Father of all of you wanted to become a weak human being before you in full concealment of My eternal and infinite, divine splendor,
CJ|0|236|33|0|so that you by this above all humble example should come to despise your old spirit of despotism!
CJ|0|236|34|0|But no, in none other than this time of all times, in which the Lord of glory has humbled Himself below all men so He may win them all in such lowliness of His, men want to be lords and rule more than ever!
CJ|0|236|35|0|I well know that you judged the four sons primarily because of Me -
CJ|0|236|36|0|but if you recognize Me as the Lord, why did you anticipate Me there?
CJ|0|236|37|0|'See, we are all far from being miserable because we have been served with a poor fish, for we can quickly have a better one prepared for us.
CJ|0|236|38|0|But the four brothers are now the most miserable beings on earth because you as their father have judged them;
CJ|0|236|39|0|and behold, that is no just punishment for such a small offence! -
CJ|0|236|40|0|What indeed would you children of men be if I did with you as you do with one another and if I were as short of temper and as impatient as you are?
CJ|0|236|41|0|You do not know why we were served so meagerly; but I know why.
CJ|0|236|42|0|Therefore I say to you: Go over and withdraw your condemnation, and James will make the reason for the poor meal known to you.'
CJ|0|236|43|0|Here Joseph went and called the four sons so they might acknowledge their error before him and be forgiven.
CJ|0|237|1|1|The Child's Love For His Brothers
CJ|0|237|1|0|AND THE FOUR SONS promptly came into Joseph's dining room, where they quickly fell down on their knees, acknowledged their guilt and besought their old father for forgiveness.
CJ|0|237|2|0|Joseph thereupon forgave them and withdrew his condemnation.
CJ|0|237|3|0|Then he said to the four, 'I have indeed forgiven you;
CJ|0|237|4|0|but I was also the least insulted by you in the matter.
CJ|0|237|5|0|Now here is the little Child of which you said to me to my greatest annoyance
CJ|0|237|6|0|that He was spoiled and therefore sometimes full of caprice, at which time nothing were right and good enough for Him.
CJ|0|237|7|0|Thereby you have abused Him most rudely!
CJ|0|237|8|0|Go over and first of all ask Him for forgiveness, or you could be severely dealt with!'
CJ|0|237|9|0|Here the four sons went over to the little Child and said to Him,
CJ|0|237|10|0|'Oh our dear little Brother! See, we have unjustly abused You to our father,
CJ|0|237|11|0|and made him so angry that he nearly put a curse on us.
CJ|0|237|12|0|We have sinned most rudely against You and the good father Joseph.
CJ|0|237|13|0|Oh will You, dear little Brother, ever be able to forgive us our rude sin? Will You lift us up again to be Your brothers?'
CJ|0|237|14|0|At this the little Child smiled at the brothers in a most friendly manner, stretched out His tender arms and said with tears in His divine eyes:
CJ|0|237|15|0|'Oh My dear brothers, arise and come here so I may kiss and bless you!
CJ|0|237|16|0|For truly, whoever comes to Me as you do, he shall be forgiven, though his sins were more than there is sand in the sea and grass on the earth!
CJ|0|237|17|0|Truly, truly, before this earth was founded, I already saw this sin in you and have already forgiven you long before you ever were.
CJ|0|237|18|0|Oh My dear brothers, do not have any fear because of Me, for I do indeed love all of you so much that I shall in fact die one day in My body from love for you.
CJ|0|237|19|0|So do not ever fear Me, for truly, even though you had cursed Me, I still would not have judged you but would have wept instead because of the hardness of your hearts!
CJ|0|237|20|0|So come here, My dear brothers, that I may bless you, since you have abused Me a bit!'
CJ|0|237|21|0|This infinite goodness of the little Child broke the hearts of the four, and they wept like little children.
CJ|0|237|22|0|The others at the table also were so greatly moved that they could not keep from weeping.
CJ|0|237|23|0|The little Child then arose and went over to the four, blessed and kissed them, and then said to them,
CJ|0|237|24|0|'Now, dear brothers, you will surely know that I have forgiven you everything?
CJ|0|237|25|0|But I beg you: go into the kitchen now and bring us all a better fish!
CJ|0|237|26|0|For truly, I am still quite hungry, but just cannot eat the fish you prepared for us a little while ago!'
CJ|0|237|27|0|At this the four quickly arose, kissed the beyond measure good-hearted little Child and then, deeply stirred, hurried into the kitchen and prepared a most excellent fish for Joseph's table.
CJ|0|238|1|1|The Interpretation Of The Poor Meal
CJ|0|238|1|0|WHEN ALL HAD STILLED their hunger with the well-prepared fish on Joseph's table
CJ|0|238|2|0|and the meal was over, Joseph asked James if he could give him a possibly prophetic reason for the at first meager and finally ever so tasty meal?
CJ|0|238|3|0|And James answered in a most humble and unassuming manner,
CJ|0|238|4|0|'Oh yes, dear father Joseph, insofar as the Lord will give it to me, to that extent will I faithfully tell you what this meal means.
CJ|0|238|5|0|So I would ask you to listen attentively!'
CJ|0|238|6|0|All now directed their attention toward James, and he began to speak as follows:
CJ|0|238|7|0|The poor and meager meal exemplified that future time in which the word of the Lord will be misrepresented.
CJ|0|238|8|0|At that time His servants will keep the best part for themselves and will feed their congregations with the husks as the heathen feed their swine.
CJ|0|238|9|0|'The Jews will be like the fried sea onion;
CJ|0|238|10|0|for although it is a root which grows luxuriantly by the ocean of divine grace and is now being fully roasted at the fire of divine love,
CJ|0|238|11|0|it will, for all that, be a poor food and a most scanty fare at the table of the Lord, and no one will reach for it.
CJ|0|238|12|0|'The monotonous milk dish will be the Greeks. These will indeed preserve the Lord's word in its true form more than anyone else;
CJ|0|238|13|0|but since they will lead only an outward but not an inward life according thereto, they will be lukewarm, unscentedqnd tasteless like this cooked dish which, although it contains the best, life-giving ingredients, is cool and poorly cooked, and thus makes a poor showing on the Lord's table also;
CJ|0|238|14|0|for it has no pleasant odor and thus, as in effect raw, also has no pleasant taste for the Lord's palate.
CJ|0|238|15|0|'The melon is Rome. This fruit grows on a creeping stem winding in all directions,
CJ|0|238|16|0|on which many barren blossoms come forth; but a fruit appears behind only a few.
CJ|0|238|17|0|And although the fruit is there and ripens to maturity, and in fact has a pleasant scent that is quite strong -
CJ|0|238|18|0|still when it is cut open and the inner meat is savored, the taste is far inferior to the scent.
CJ|0|238|19|0|If seasoned honey is not eaten with it, nausea to the point of vomiting quickly follows,
CJ|0|238|20|0|yes, even death can easily result from partaking of this fruit!
CJ|0|238|21|0|This is the way it will be with Rome for a considerable time, and many will eat themselves to death at this fare. This fruit will also be present as a bad dish on the Lord's table and will not be touched by Him.
CJ|0|238|22|0|'Now we still have bread, butter, some honey and a few lean fish.
CJ|0|238|23|0|These foods are naturally somewhat better, are noticeably separated from the others and appear to be quite acceptable;
CJ|0|238|24|0|but there is no warmth in them either, for they have not all been seasoned with the main ingredient, the fire, therefore they also stand here on the Lord's table and are not praised.
CJ|0|238|25|0|The fish, of course, were at the fire, but they had too little fat, consequently they are as tough as straw and the Lord cannot partake of them either.
CJ|0|238|26|0|'These foods denote certain sects which will separate themselves from the former and will indeed have faith,
CJ|0|238|27|0|but it will not be possible to discover any or at least very little love in them, hence they also will not be pleasing to the Lord.
CJ|0|238|28|0|That in short is the meaning of this meal. I have imparted everything made known to me, and since I received nothing more, I shall say no more!' - This explanation caused a great stir, but no one understood it.
CJ|0|239|1|1|One Flock And One Shepherd
CJ|0|239|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH said to James, 'You have spoken most wisely in the name of the Lord although I, along with the others, still cannot grasp what you have spoken.
CJ|0|239|2|0|But since I recognize the wisdom of God in you just the same,
CJ|0|239|3|0|and we were all finally given a select and very tastily prepared fish for our table,
CJ|0|239|4|0|I would also like to have you explain what this highly palatable and select fish finally represents.
CJ|0|239|5|0|The Lord will surely reveal to you what is good also,
CJ|0|239|6|0|since He has just shown you what is and will be bad for all the world.'
CJ|0|239|7|0|And James replied, 'Dear father Joseph, that does not depend on me, but on the Lord alone.
CJ|0|239|8|0|I am only a weak instrument of the Lord and can only speak when the Lord loosens my tongue.
CJ|0|239|9|0|So do not request of me what I do not have and therefore cannot give you,
CJ|0|239|10|0|but turn to the Lord in the matter - if He will give it to me, then you shall immediately receive it from me as He gives it!'
CJ|0|239|11|0|Here Joseph turned to the little Child and asked in a low tone of voice,
CJ|0|239|12|0|'My Jesus, let me know the meaning of the good fish also!'
CJ|0|239|13|0|But the little Child replied, 'Joseph, you can see that I have not quite finished with My fish, so be patient.
CJ|0|239|14|0|Cyrenius also is still far from finished with his meal; so we two still have half an hour's time,
CJ|0|239|15|0|in which much can be deliberated and decided on.'
CJ|0|239|16|0|Thereupon He turned to James and said to him,
CJ|0|239|17|0|'James, while I am eating this small piece of fish, you may as well speak what comes to your mind.'
CJ|0|239|18|0|The little Child then ate of His fish again, and James promptly began to speak as follows:
CJ|0|239|19|0|This last good fish represents the Lord's love and His great compassion which He will bestow upon mankind in that time when all the world will stand on the abyss of eternal death.
CJ|0|239|20|0|But before this the cooks will have to withstand a strong judgment.
CJ|0|239|21|0|'Only after this judgment will that time come which the prophet Isaiah has already foretold.
CJ|0|239|22|0|And this time will remain on the earth and will not be taken from it henceforth, and the earth will be transformed into the likeness of the sun,
CJ|0|239|23|0|and her inhabitants will also dwell on the sun's great fields of light and will shine as they do.
CJ|0|239|24|0|And the Lord will be Lord alone and will be the Shepherd Himself, and all the shining inhabitants will be one flock!
CJ|0|239|25|0|And thus the earth will remain forever, and her inhabitants forever, and the Lord will be among them forever - a Father to His children in eternity!
CJ|0|239|26|0|There will be no more death; whoever lives then will live forever and will never see death! Amen.'
CJ|0|239|27|0|Here James was silent again, and the whole company was altogether speechless from surprise at the great wisdom of James - whereupon the little Child finally said, 'And now I have finished with the fish - therefore: Amen - to this also!'
CJ|0|240|1|1|The Poor Testimony Of The Worldly Neighbors
CJ|0|240|1|0|SOON AFTERWARD the company arose from the table and thanked God for the bodily as well as the spiritual food, after which most of them went out into the open.
CJ|0|240|2|0|Only Joseph, Mary and the little Child along with James went into the great dining hall where Cyrenius was still at the table with his guests.
CJ|0|240|3|0|He welcomed his dearest friends in a most friendly manner and wanted to get up at once and make room for them.
CJ|0|240|4|0|But the little Child said, 'Oh stay, stay where you are, My dear Cyrenius!
CJ|0|240|5|0|I am already satisfied if I just have the proper place in your heart!
CJ|0|240|6|0|As concerns this place at the table here, it means nothing to Me.
CJ|0|240|7|0|I am now going outside with James - when you have finished your meal, come out after Me!'
CJ|0|240|8|0|Thereupon the little Child with His James ran quickly outside and there conversed with him and the other children.
CJ|0|240|9|0|This very intelligent and quite intimate speech of the little Child with Cyrenius aroused the attention of several of the guests from the city,
CJ|0|240|10|0|and they asked just how old this little Child might be,
CJ|0|240|11|0|since He already talked like a grown man and seemed to be on very good terms with the governor.
CJ|0|240|12|0|To this Cyrenius replied, 'What is it to you that I am a great friend of children?
CJ|0|240|13|0|You have all seen that this little Child is exceptionally gifted;
CJ|0|240|14|0|but as to how He has attained such clear understanding at the age of hardly two and a half years,
CJ|0|240|15|0|you will have to ask His parents, who will no doubt be able to enlighten you best in the matter.
CJ|0|240|16|0|Besides, I am greatly surprised that you as the nearest neighbors do not know this house and its inhabitants any better by now!'
CJ|0|240|17|0|Here a few said, 'Well, and how should we really know this family better?
CJ|0|240|18|0|To begin with, they never go anywhere, and in the second place, we just have too little time to visit this singular Jewish family which is very difficult to fathom,
CJ|0|240|19|0|for it has such a singular, mystical manner that one does not know exactly what to make of it.
CJ|0|240|20|0|As far as we have heard from other quite insignificant people, this family is of course very peaceful and does much good to the poor;
CJ|0|240|21|0|but there are some who say that they have seen this house as if it were in bright flames which then went out again as quickly as one could say yes and no, and a number of other things like that.
CJ|0|240|22|0|Therefore we just do not have the courage to visit this family;
CJ|0|240|23|0|for the old man is nothing else than a Jewish head sorcerer,
CJ|0|240|24|0|and it is not good to have anything whatever to do with people of that sort!'
CJ|0|240|25|0|At this Cyrenius laughed and retorted, 'Well, in that case just keep on looking at it that way, for then this house is safe from you!' - At this the guests made big eyes at Cyrenius and did not know what to make of this.
CJ|0|241|1|1|The Evil Plan Of The Neighbors
CJ|0|241|1|0|HEREUPON A LEADING CITIZEN of Ostracine asked the governor what he meant by that, saying,
CJ|0|241|2|0|'Why should this house be safe, if one - perhaps erroneously - holds this old Jew to be an arch sorcerer?'
CJ|0|241|3|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Because a weak human being can accomplish nothing where the power of the from all eternity existing Deity holds His protective hand.
CJ|0|241|4|0|And this house, like no other in the whole wide world, stands under the almighty protection of that Deity, therefore it is also unconquerable!
CJ|0|241|5|0|Lay your hand on this house with evil intentions, and you will promptly find out how matters stand with it!' - Thereupon he left the table, accompanied by the garrison commander and the captain.
CJ|0|241|6|0|At this the leading citizens were taken aback and said to one another,
CJ|0|241|7|0|'The governor just wants to frighten us because he has no military force with him.
CJ|0|241|8|0|If we really were to lay our hands on this house and on his person, you may be sure that he would soon speak a different language!
CJ|0|241|9|0|So let us arise from the table and go into the city and return towards evening with a strong force,
CJ|0|241|10|0|and then we shall promptly see whether the governor will still use this sort of language!'
CJ|0|241|11|0|Soon thereafter the leading citizens arose from the table and went outside
CJ|0|241|12|0|where they, as well as the garrison commander and the captain, took leave from Cyrenius and started on their way back to the city.
CJ|0|241|13|0|Here Joseph went over to the citizens and asked,
CJ|0|241|14|0|'Why do you want to leave so soon, when the sun will still shine for at least an hour?
CJ|0|241|15|0|Stay until evening, when we will all accompany Cyrenius to his ship as it is fitting -
CJ|0|241|16|0|for he departs for Tyre already tonight and will therefore ready and board his ship yet today.'
CJ|0|241|17|0|But those thus addressed excused themselves and replied, 'We still have some very important business ahead of us today, so excuse us to your very close friend!'
CJ|0|241|18|0|Here the little Child came running over and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|241|19|0|'Just let them go into the city, for their business is of a nature which must serve to glorify My name!'
CJ|0|241|20|0|At this Joseph let the guests go their way and with the little Child went over to Cyrenius and told him how these had excused themselves, and what the little Child had said.
CJ|0|241|21|0|And Cyrenius replied, 'Oh my esteemed brother, this sort I know!
CJ|0|241|22|0|They are jealous and cannot contain nor control themselves from all their inward gall because I visited your house and ignored them;
CJ|0|241|23|0|but I am very calm thereat as far as you are concerned, for I plainly know under whose protection you stand!'
CJ|0|241|24|0|And the little Child affirmed, 'Oh, the parched road shall become hot for them!
CJ|0|241|25|0|They want to destroy our house even today, and that with fire;
CJ|0|241|26|0|but they shall not gain the time to do so, for they shall quickly have enough to do at home!'
CJ|0|241|27|0|The little Child had hardly finished speaking these words, when half the city already stood in flames - and no one thought about destroying Joseph's house any more.
CJ|0|242|1|1|He Who Digs A Pit For Another
CJ|0|242|1|0|ALL NOW TOOK FRIGHT when they suddenly beheld the enormous mass of smoke and flames rising into the air.
CJ|0|242|2|0|And Cyrenius asked Joseph whether aid should not be rushed to these terribly hard-pressed people.
CJ|0|242|3|0|But Joseph answered, I would say that we should stand aside!,
CJ|0|242|4|0|And besides we are helpless to put out the fire with our natural or human capabilities;
CJ|0|242|5|0|and as concerns those who lose their possession thereby, they will meet us soon enough and at the proper time.
CJ|0|242|6|0|So let us be quite undisturbed, for whoever feels a need to come here will surely do so!'
CJ|0|242|7|0|And the little Child at Joseph's side assured him; saying, 'See, dear Joseph, that will make your chest of gold and silver considerably lighter also!
CJ|0|242|8|0|You too, Cyrenius, will lose a few pounds of gold and silver still today before your departure;
CJ|0|242|9|0|for those who were here and secretly threatened to destroy our house will soon return here as greatly humbled friends and will ask you to give them aid.
CJ|0|242|10|0|So just be prepared for that! But do not suppose that I was the One who sent this blaze upon their houses by My power;
CJ|0|242|11|0|for I do no such thing, and any sort of revenge is far from Me!
CJ|0|242|12|0|'I now tell you: Their servants have done this to them,
CJ|0|242|13|0|for they have already had a rancor against their masters for a long time because they were treated in a harsh and miserly way.
CJ|0|242|14|0|Today they found the most favorable opportunity to revenge themselves against their masters
CJ|0|242|15|0|by putting the torch to all their stately mansions.
CJ|0|242|16|0|And thus, without My taking a hand in the matter, these lords of the world have fallen into the very pit which they intended to prepare for us!'
CJ|0|242|17|0|When Cyrenius heard this from the little Child, he swiftly asked Him whether these bad servants should not be pursued.
CJ|0|242|18|0|And the little Child replied: 'Oh, do not bother with that! For to begin with they have accomplished a good thing with their hard-hearted masters -
CJ|0|242|19|0|in the second place they are already long gone over hill and dale with the stolen treasure -
CJ|0|242|20|0|and besides they will not escape their just punishment, since they took the law into their own hands out of wicked revenge!
CJ|0|242|21|0|So let us be concerned primarily with those who will need our help!
CJ|0|242|22|0|But as concerns the incendiarists, they will be attended to.
CJ|0|242|23|0|Behold, God sees them wherever they are and knows their route exactly.
CJ|0|242|24|0|Therefore He can also seize them anywhere, let them be where they may.
CJ|0|242|25|0|God is also a most just judge to everyone; therefore He will know the proper reward to give them for their deed!'
CJ|0|242|26|0|Here Mary came up quite anxiously and showed Joseph a large troop of armed warriors that moved toward the villa in great haste.
CJ|0|242|27|0|But the little Child said, 'Oh, do not be afraid - that is the protective guard for Cyrenius, which the garrison commander now sends from the city for everyone's protection.
CJ|0|242|28|0|A large number of citizens will soon follow the guard.
CJ|0|242|29|0|So you need only be concerned for their lodging - everything else will take care of itself!'
CJ|0|242|30|0|And as the little Child stated, so it was: Cyrenius received a protective guard which was soon followed by a great many burned-out citizens.
CJ|0|243|1|1|A Memorable Example Of Charity
CJ|0|243|1|0|WHEN THE BURNED-OUT CITIZENS arrived at the villa, Joseph soon recognized that they were the same lords who had recently been his guests, and asked them,
CJ|0|243|2|0|'Well, my greatly esteemed lords, what happened to your important business which only a little while ago caused you to hurry away so quickly?
CJ|0|243|3|0|Was it that you set your city on fire?
CJ|0|243|4|0|Or did it consist in quite another matter which has to be kept secret from me?'
CJ|0|243|5|0|At this the burned-out citizens replied, 'Dear friend of humanity, do not examine us in our misery, for you can see that we are now out-and-out beggars!
CJ|0|243|6|0|If you can assist us in any way then do so, and we will be your chattels for the rest of our lives!'
CJ|0|243|7|0|And Joseph said: 'Only Rome's mighty patricians deal in slaves and chattels;
CJ|0|243|8|0|but I deal only in brothers who are always equally my brothers, whether as lords or as beggars.
CJ|0|243|9|0|Therefore I shall also assist you as best I can.
CJ|0|243|10|0|But when you are settled on your property again, never undertake another such business as you planned to do today!
CJ|0|243|11|0|For as much as it now hurts you that your servants and slaves have robbed you so basely and set your houses on fire,
CJ|0|243|12|0|so it would have hurt me and still more, if you had done the same to me!'
CJ|0|243|13|0|Thereupon Joseph went over to Cyrenius and asked him how much should be given these unfortunates at one time.
CJ|0|243|14|0|And Cyrenius answered, 'Wait just a short time! My bearers, whom I sent aboard ship for my cash box, will soon be here.
CJ|0|243|15|0|Once I am in possession of my larger cash box, we will see how much shall be allotted to those who are already here as well as those who will arrive.'
CJ|0|243|16|0|In a short hour the messengers brought a thousand bags of gold and silver.
CJ|0|243|17|0|And each pouch, which weighed ten pounds, was a mixture of two pounds of gold and eight pounds of silver.
CJ|0|243|18|0|At this Cyrenius advised Joseph, 'You distribute these pouches among these burned-out citizens in such a manner that each receives one pouch.
CJ|0|243|19|0|Then keep the remaining pouches in custody for those who will arrive later.
CJ|0|243|20|0|But I do not want to be present at the distribution so I will not be recognized by all the people who will come here.
CJ|0|243|21|0|Therefore I shall now go with Jonathan to his home and hope to see you in the evening.'
CJ|0|243|22|0|Joseph agreed to this and promptly undertook the distribution with his sons; and Cyrenius secretly departed with all of his servants of state and with Jonathan.
CJ|0|244|1|1|Though We Lose All - But Have The Lord
CJ|0|244|1|0|FOR TWO HOURS after sundown Joseph was busy with the distribution,
CJ|0|244|2|0|and also provided a shelter for those deprived of their homes and a means of livelihood,
CJ|0|244|3|0|since only a few dared to spend the night in the city, partly because of the strong stench from the fire,
CJ|0|244|4|0|and also from fear that the fire might at any moment seize one or the other still untouched house.
CJ|0|244|5|0|When Joseph had thus completed his business, he privately asked the little Child whether it might now be safe to leave the house and to go over to Jonathan.
CJ|0|244|6|0|And the little Child answered, 'What do you care about the house and its contents?
CJ|0|244|7|0|After all, it does not belong to us, but to him who bought it as well as the contents - which also belong to the buyer.
CJ|0|244|8|0|So let us just go over to Jonathan who surely has a good fish waiting for us!'
CJ|0|244|9|0|And Joseph said, 'That is of course true,
CJ|0|244|10|0|but consider that we have a chest full of gold and silver, and cows, goats and donkeys.
CJ|0|244|11|0|Could these not be robbed by these now very many guests?'
CJ|0|244|12|0|Here the little Child said, 'Joseph, that is beyond Me at present;
CJ|0|244|13|0|so discuss it with James who understands these matters better now than I do.'
CJ|0|244|14|0|Joseph thereupon put the same question to James.
CJ|0|244|15|0|And James answered: 'Father, and if we lost everything and still have the Lord, what would we really have lost?
CJ|0|244|16|0|Now the Lord is going with us to Jonathan - what then should we fear to lose here in the house of the governor?
CJ|0|244|17|0|Let yourself be robbed of the whole earth but keep the Lord, and you have more than if all the heavens and the worlds were your very own possession!
CJ|0|244|18|0|Go now, o most upright man, with the Lord to Jonathan without fear or worry, and you will assure yourself that we will lose nothing!'
CJ|0|244|19|0|These words of the Lord from the mouth of James becalmed Joseph so greatly that he at once made his departure with all of his kinsfolk and went to Jonathan.
CJ|0|244|20|0|There all were already awaiting the arrival of Joseph with the greatest anticipation.
CJ|0|244|21|0|And when he came into sight they ran toward him like children toward their father, with Cyrenius in their midst.
CJ|0|244|22|0|And when Joseph with his kinsfolk was thus led into Jonathan's house, the latter quickly had the well-prepared fish served up and all partook of their evening meal.
CJ|0|245|1|1|Joseph To Cyrenius - Follow The Lord's Counsel
CJ|0|245|1|0|AFTER THIS EVENING MEAL was completed, Cyrenius ordered his crew to make the ship ready for departure.
CJ|0|245|2|0|And the crew in a short time put everything on board ship in top order.
CJ|0|245|3|0|James now went over to Cyrenius with the others and asked him if in his haste he had not forgotten the marvelous earth-globe which the little Child had presented to him a couple of days ago.
CJ|0|245|4|0|At this question Cyrenius literally took hold of his hair and immediately wanted to run after it himself.
CJ|0|245|5|0|But James said, 'Oh Cyrenius, do not concern yourself about it;
CJ|0|245|6|0|for what you have forgotten, I have remembered!
CJ|0|245|7|0|See, here in this corner wrapped in a cloth is the earth-globe, so you need not hasten to our home for it.'
CJ|0|245|8|0|Here Cyrenius was full of joy, took the treasure himself and carried it to the ship where he gave it to his ship's captain to be kept with greatest care.
CJ|0|245|9|0|When this matter was attended to, Cyrenius went over to Joseph and said to him,
CJ|0|245|10|0|'Kindly listen to me now, my above all esteemed friend and brother, for I have now had an inspiration which must be acted upon.
CJ|0|245|11|0|See, you now have a great many people in your house, and a few will remain with you.
CJ|0|245|12|0|Now my children do after all cause you more or less worry and many an inconvenience and, as I have noticed myself, especially the three boys.
CJ|0|245|13|0|Therefore I have now made up my mind to at least take the three boys with me and to leave only the Five girls with you.'
CJ|0|245|14|0|Joseph replied, 'My very dear brother, do what you think best, and everything will be agreeable with me.
CJ|0|245|15|0|But be sure to do all that according to the counsel of the Lord so that everything will be for the best.
CJ|0|245|16|0|For that reason ask the Lord in this matter also, and then do what He tells you!'
CJ|0|245|17|0|Here Cyrenius promptly turned to the little Child in deepest love and reverence and asked Him according to Joseph's advice.
CJ|0|245|18|0|And the little Child said, 'Yes, yes, just take the three really troublesome boys with you - that is all right with Me.
CJ|0|245|19|0|Sixtus would, for that matter, still be acceptable to Me, but he too is not always the same and will not give Me credit in anything.
CJ|0|245|20|0|So just take him along too and be sure to be quite strict with them, or they will become out and out worldlings.
CJ|0|245|21|0|But the girls you can leave here; for I love them much better since they also love Me more than the boys.
CJ|0|245|22|0|But I do not love them more because they are girls, but only because of their greater love to Me.'
CJ|0|245|23|0|Upon this declaration Cyrenius took the three boys and thanked the little Child for this splendid advice and then had them promptly brought on board ship.
CJ|0|246|1|1|Where Your Heart Is - There Is Your Treasure
CJ|0|246|1|0|WHEN THE SHIP was ready to make its departure, Cyrenius went over to the little Child, knelt down before Him and asked Him for His blessing with the following words:
CJ|0|246|2|0|'O Lord, my great God, my Creator, my Father from eternity,
CJ|0|246|3|0|who now walks this dust we call the earth in our form as a frail human being -
CJ|0|246|4|0|my almighty Lord at whose lightest nod all the powers of infinity tremble,
CJ|0|246|5|0|oh look graciously upon me, a nothing before You,
CJ|0|246|6|0|and honor me, a worm in the dust before Your infinite Holiness, with Your most gracious blessing!
CJ|0|246|7|0|O my life, let me find all my power and strength in Your most holy Name,
CJ|0|246|8|0|and, o ancient King of my heart, look graciously and forgivingly upon me a poor, weak sinner and help me that I shall grow ever more in love toward You!
CJ|0|246|9|0|O my eternally above all beloved Jesus, take my love as a token of my gratitude for the infinite grace and mercy which You bestow upon me with every breath!'
CJ|0|246|10|0|Here Cyrenius' heart broke from sheer love, and he could not continue for tears.
CJ|0|246|11|0|Thereupon the little Child joyously embraced Cyrenius and replied:
CJ|0|246|12|0|'Oh do not weep, My beloved Cyrenius - for you can see that I love you beyond measure!
CJ|0|246|13|0|And in this My love for you lies My greatest blessing!
CJ|0|246|14|0|I tell you, if you remain as you are, you will belong to Me forever, and never in all eternity will your soul feel nor taste death!
CJ|0|246|15|0|But as you have now asked Me for this blessing so also do I ask you not to disclose Me to anyone.
CJ|0|246|16|0|This I do not ask of you for My sake, but for the world's sake;
CJ|0|246|17|0|for death would be its lot if it recognized Me before My time!'-
CJ|0|246|18|0|After these words the little Child embraced Cyrenius once more and kissed him.
CJ|0|246|19|0|At this Cyrenius spread out his arms and declared:
CJ|0|246|20|0|'O my eternal God! - What am I, that You should kiss me with the mouth that ushered forth all creation?
CJ|0|246|21|0|Oh shining heavens, oh earth, oh powers of the heavens! Look, look this way!
CJ|0|246|22|0|He, who created you and me, is here before me and blesses me with His almighty hand!
CJ|0|246|23|0|'When will you, oh earth, grasp the magnitude of grace bestowed in this time when the feet of your eternal Lord and Creator walked your ground?
CJ|0|246|24|0|Oh most holy ground that carries the Lord, will you ever comprehend the greatness of such grace in all gratitude, breaking yourself into dust in humility?
CJ|0|246|25|0|Oh holy place, how difficult it is for me to leave you!' -
CJ|0|246|26|0|Here the little Child as good as lifted Cyrenius up and did not allow him to kneel any more.
CJ|0|246|27|0|Thereupon Tullia and Maronius Pilla also came over, and the little Child blessed them all, and all wept because they now had to part again.
CJ|0|246|28|0|But the little Child reassured them, saying, 'Oh, oh, we are not really parting! For where your heart is, there is your treasure also!'
CJ|0|246|29|0|With these words all comforted themselves and arose from the ground.
CJ|0|247|1|1|Only Love Can Bear My Presence
CJ|0|247|1|0|THEREUPON JOSEPH went over to Cyrenius and blessed him along with his whole house.
CJ|0|247|2|0|And Mary also went over and blessed Tullia and her companions.
CJ|0|247|3|0|Joseph then said to Cyrenius, 'Brother, with this my blessing I also want to tell you the wish of my heart, which is this:
CJ|0|247|4|0|Let me have the five girls altogether, so they may have their father wholly in me!
CJ|0|247|5|0|For you will have children of your own anyhow who later on would not get along well with these.
CJ|0|247|6|0|But with me there will never be any disharmony on that account - the reason for which you know as well as I do.'
CJ|0|247|7|0|And Cyrenius gladly acceded to Joseph's wish and gave him the five girls wholly as his own, which made Joseph very happy,
CJ|0|247|8|0|for he loved the little maidens because they were so easy to teach and most tractable, and were of good stature and a lovely form.
CJ|0|247|9|0|When this was settled, Cyrenius embraced Joseph and said,
CJ|0|247|10|0|'Brother, if it is the Lord's will, then I hope to see you again soon.'
CJ|0|247|11|0|And the little Child, who stood beside Joseph, affirmed: 'Amen say I! - If not here, then surely in My kingdom!
CJ|0|247|12|0|For I tell you: We will not be in this country much longer because we are already too well known.
CJ|0|247|13|0|But when we leave here we will withdraw ourselves into seclusion so no human being will come under judgment.
CJ|0|247|14|0|Just the same - we who are one in love will at all times and forever be present to one another in the spirit!'
CJ|0|247|15|0|'Where your treasure is, there you will also be with your heart, wherein the main treasure dwells.
CJ|0|247|16|0|When I become a costly treasure to you in your heart, truly, then you shall eternally never lose Me!
CJ|0|247|17|0|For where I dwell in love, there I am in truth at home the most and eternally never leave such an abode.
CJ|0|247|18|0|Allow Me, therefore, to constantly dwell in your heart, and I shall dwell in no seclusion for you!
CJ|0|247|19|0|'For only love can bear My presence, like one fire the other.
CJ|0|247|20|0|And everything that is not fire will be destroyed and devoured by the fire.
CJ|0|247|21|0|For that reason do I also withdraw Myself from the world, so My fire will not seize and destroy it.
CJ|0|247|22|0|But never in any case ask: Lord, where are You? - For in that case I shall not say to you: Here I am!
CJ|0|247|23|0|Instead carefully ask your heart if it loves Me, and I shall call out to you in your heart, which loves Me:
CJ|0|247|24|0|Here I am at home in all fullness of My love, grace and compassion! -
CJ|0|247|25|0|Now board your ship in good cheer, and a good wind shall carry you to Tyre. Amen.'
CJ|0|247|26|0|Hereupon the governor Cyrenius took his leave with Joseph in Egypt for the last time and boarded his ship.
CJ|0|247|27|0|And a good wind quickly came and hurried away with the ship.
CJ|0|247|28|0|Joseph thereupon went into Jonathan's house with his family and remained with him this night.
CJ|0|248|1|1|Jonathan Saves Another Roman Ship
CJ|0|248|1|0|ON THE MORNING of the following day Joseph, as usual, was the first one up and soon thereafter awakened his family.
CJ|0|248|2|0|And Jonathan, who just came from his chamber to see what sort of a day it would be for his trade, asked Joseph,
CJ|0|248|3|0|'But my dear friend and brother, what are you doing up so early, and how is it that you also prompt your family to arise?
CJ|0|248|4|0|Should you not wait on the Lord until He arises from sleep?
CJ|0|248|5|0|Would that after all not be the best time to arise in the morning?
CJ|0|248|6|0|Therefore I beg you to at least allow your family a couple of hours' more rest.
CJ|0|248|7|0|And you come with me and with my men in my boat, and we shall make a morning-catch.'
CJ|0|248|8|0|This offer well pleased Joseph, and he left his family rest and promptly went with Jonathan into his large fishing boat.
CJ|0|248|9|0|Jonathan's fishermen put the nets in order and then wielded the oars with great energy,
CJ|0|248|10|0|and in an hour the early morning fishermen were already at the spot that had the most fish.
CJ|0|248|11|0|But when they reached this always favorable fishing spot and the sun was close to rising,
CJ|0|248|12|0|Jonathan noticed a Roman ship standing about an hour's distance away and did not know what to make of it.
CJ|0|248|13|0|He therefore said to Joseph, 'Brother, I know the sea over there -
CJ|0|248|14|0|it is shallow and full of sandbanks, and a seafarer of Rome can very easily have gone aground there.
CJ|0|248|15|0|We should therefore hasten to give help as fast as possible!'
CJ|0|248|16|0|And Joseph was of the same mind, so it was decided to row over to there at once. And when the ship was reached in half an hour,
CJ|0|248|17|0|behold, it actually was a large Roman ship which carried an envoy to Cyrenius!
CJ|0|248|18|0|The envoy was immediately taken on board and asked Jonathan to make every possible attempt to save the ship.
CJ|0|248|19|0|Thereupon Jonathan promptly seized the towing line of the great ship and then had his fishermen row energetically in his large boat.
CJ|0|248|20|0|And within half an hour the large ship was refloated.
CJ|0|248|21|0|At this the Roman envoy rewarded Jonathan richly and then sailed on toward the morning.
CJ|0|248|22|0|And Jonathan turned homeward with gold and silver instead of the fish and did not try to fish any more that morning.
CJ|0|249|1|1|Jonathan Makes A Rich Catch Of Fish
CJ|0|249|1|0|WHEN, AFTER ABOUT THREE HOURS, Jonathan returned with Joseph and with his catch of gold and silver, everyone in the house had already risen and looked toward the still heavily smoking city.
CJ|0|249|2|0|But the little Child with James hurried toward Joseph and Jonathan as they were approaching the shore.
CJ|0|249|3|0|And when they stepped ashore, He greeted and kissed both of them and asked Jonathan whether he had already made a big catch of fish.
CJ|0|249|4|0|The latter also embraced the little Child most lovingly and declared,
CJ|0|249|5|0|'O my life, my love! I have done something more important today than catching fish!
CJ|0|249|6|0|For I have, surely with Your almighty help, saved a stranded Roman ship which carried an envoy to Cyrenius.
CJ|0|249|7|0|At this time a great many gold and silver fish fell into my net, so I gave up the actual fishing for today.'
CJ|0|249|8|0|Here the Child said, 'I can understand that,
CJ|0|249|9|0|but since I have really looked forward to getting a fresh fish today, it would have pleased Me more if instead of your gold and silver fish you had brought real ones !'
CJ|0|249|10|0|Jonathan answered, 'O my life! See, there suspended along the shore are a number of cisterns full of the best fish, so we can be sure of eating fish that are really fresh.'
CJ|0|249|11|0|At this the little Child smiled and said, 'Well, in that case you certainly do not need to go fishing any more.
CJ|0|249|12|0|But I am already quite hungry - will it take long until a fish is prepared?'
CJ|0|249|13|0|And Jonathan answered, 'Oh, no, my life, no, in half an hour we will already be sitting at the table.'
CJ|0|249|14|0|Here Joseph said to the little Child, 'My, but You are a regular beggar.
CJ|0|249|15|0|See, we are not really at home here, therefore we must not act as if we were at home.
CJ|0|249|16|0|So just be patient - You will get something to eat all right - but to beg like that is just not proper in a strange house.'
CJ|0|249|17|0|But the little Child retorted: 'Oh, what of it! I am at home wherever I am loved.
CJ|0|249|18|0|And where I am thus at home, I surely may and can say what I want to.
CJ|0|249|19|0|But so Jonathan shall not be without a reward for giving us of his fish,
CJ|0|249|20|0|let him throw his net into the sea and he shall promptly make a generous catch for us all! - Jonathan, go ahead and do that.'
CJ|0|249|21|0|Jonathan thereupon cast a large net into the sea and caught an unheard-of number of the most select fish.
CJ|0|249|22|0|At this the little Child remarked to Joseph, 'See, if that is in My power, then I can surely ask Jonathan for a good fish.' - Here Joseph was silent, and Jonathan just could not help himself for sheer gratitude.
CJ|0|250|1|1|The Wages Of The World
CJ|0|250|1|0|JONATHAN now took ten of the best fish and gave them to his cook to be quickly prepared.
CJ|0|250|2|0|Then he assisted his helpers in bringing the catch partly into barrels and partly into the smoke shed.
CJ|0|250|3|0|In a quarter of an hour the fish were ready to eat, and all members of Joseph's family went to partake of the morning meal.
CJ|0|250|4|0|When the meal was completed it was already close to noon, and Joseph announced,
CJ|0|250|5|0|'Now we must lose no time in getting home.
CJ|0|250|6|0|And you, brother Jonathan, will accompany me and will spend the day at my house.'
CJ|0|250|7|0|And Jonathan, full of joy in his heart, replied,
CJ|0|250|8|0|'Oh brother, there is nothing I would rather do, for you know that I love you beyond measure!'
CJ|0|250|9|0|Thereupon Jonathan again took three large casks full of the choicest fish and in an exuberant frame of mind went to the villa with Joseph and his family.
CJ|0|250|10|0|When they arrived there, they were greatly surprised to see that all of the burned-out citizens were gone,
CJ|0|250|11|0|and that the house stood there quite empty with all its doors open.
CJ|0|250|12|0|At this Joseph said, That is not a good sign;
CJ|0|250|13|0|for thieves appear to have been active here! They are the sort who flee when they have robbed a house, while an honest man remains.
CJ|0|250|14|0|Go inside, my sons, and see whether anything is left in the house, and then come and tell me!'
CJ|0|250|15|0|And the four sons went and searched the house and found it to be completely plundered with the exception of the livestock in the stable.
CJ|0|250|16|0|The larder was also empty, and not a penny was to be found in the money chest.
CJ|0|250|17|0|Since the four sons found matters to be in this state, they became very sad and returned and made all this known to Joseph.
CJ|0|250|18|0|Here Joseph became angry at the baseness of people who for charities reward their benefactors with this sort of gratitude.
CJ|0|250|19|0|And he declared grimly, 'Truly, if it were in my power to punish such infamous rabble in a way that would hurt them most, I would immediately let fire rain from heaven on the heads of such thieves!'
CJ|0|250|20|0|Here the little Child went over to Joseph and said: 'Now, now, father Joseph, you are very severe today!
CJ|0|250|21|0|The thieves have after all still left you Me, so how can you be so very angry with them?
CJ|0|250|22|0|See, the thieves have only benefited your house very greatly in that they have thus made it clean!
CJ|0|250|23|0|'For truly, where in the future a house (the heart of man) is not thus cleansed, I shall not move into it!
CJ|0|250|24|0|This house is now purified from all worldly dross, and thus I like it very well!
CJ|0|250|25|0|For to begin with, it is open in all of its closets and rooms,
CJ|0|250|26|0|and secondly it is fully cleansed and thus is now quite suited for My entry; so do not be angry with the thieves, that their sin may not become greater!'
CJ|0|250|27|0|Joseph and all the others took these words to heart, and the little Child finally asserted:
CJ|0|250|28|0|'See, all mankind acts toward Me like these burned-out thieves toward this house, but I still do not let fire rain from heaven.
CJ|0|250|29|0|And in like manner do none of you curse those who do evil for good, so you will be true children of the one Father in heaven!' - These words completely becalmed Joseph, and he went into his house in good spirits.
CJ|0|251|1|1|Jonathan As A Friend in Need
CJ|0|251|1|0|WHEN ALL WERE in the house and Mary had also convinced herself that even her clothes cabinet and that of Eudokia were wholly plundered,
CJ|0|251|2|0|the tears came into her eyes as well as Eudokia's, and she complained to Joseph,
CJ|0|251|3|0|'Just look here, even the dress which I had in the temple has been robbed by wicked people!
CJ|0|251|4|0|Truly, this really upsets and hurts me in my heart!
CJ|0|251|5|0|We had only as few clothes as we absolutely needed, and still we had to lose even those.
CJ|0|251|6|0|For that matter, may everything be offered up to the Lord, but it pains me all the same because it was all I had for a necessary change of clothes.
CJ|0|251|7|0|Now I only have this already worn-out everyday dress and not even a shekel to purchase the most necessary change of clothing!
CJ|0|251|8|0|And that really hurts me! But it hurts me still more that the wicked thieves have also taken the underclothing of the little Child!
CJ|0|251|9|0|He now has nothing but the little shirt which He is wearing - how will I now be able to provide Him with a second one?
CJ|0|251|10|0|Oh my poor little Child, see, see, now I will not be able to put a fresh little shirt on you every day, which always made You feel so good!'
CJ|0|251|11|0|Here Jonathan, deeply touched, went over and said, 'Oh most honored, more than blessed mother of my Lord, do not mourn; for now I also have gold and silver!
CJ|0|251|12|0|With the greatest joy I will indeed give it to you to the last stater, and you can then use it according to your needs.
CJ|0|251|13|0|I do of course well know that the Lord of all glory does not look upon my gold and silver; for He who clothes all the animals and all the trees and plants so magnificently will all the less allow the mother of His body to, become naked.
CJ|0|251|14|0|But just the same, it would make me happy beyond measure if I could bring all of my wealth to you as an offering.
CJ|0|251|15|0|Oh mother, accept it from my heart!'
CJ|0|251|16|0|Here Mary looked at Jonathan in a most friendly manner and replied,
CJ|0|251|17|0|'Oh Jonathan, how big-hearted and noble you are! Your will counts as the deed with me.
CJ|0|251|18|0|And if it should be pleasing to the Lord, I would indeed ask you for some support for the little Child.
CJ|0|251|19|0|But if for some reason it should not be pleasing to the Lord, I have already received everything from your heart, for which I shall never cease to be grateful to you!'
CJ|0|251|20|0|Here the little Child came up and said to Jonathan, 'Dear Jonathan, give mother what she asks of you, and you will receive a great reward in My kingdom!
CJ|0|251|21|0|You see, we are really poor now, and that all the more since I must not work any wonder because of the salvation of mankind!'
CJ|0|251|22|0|At this Jonathan ran home full of joy and in a very short time brought all his gold and silver and laid it at Mary's feet.
CJ|0|251|23|0|When Mary and Joseph saw this, both wept for joy.
CJ|0|251|24|0|Jonathan wept with them and could not thank God enough that he was worthy of such grace from the Lord.
CJ|0|251|25|0|Hereupon the little Child blessed Jonathan and said to Mary, 'See, that will surely provide us with fresh linen, so be of good cheer again!' - And all became happy and cheerful again.
CJ|0|252|1|1|James Tells Of God's Wonders In All Things
CJ|0|252|1|0|WHILE THIS was going on, Joseph's sons took care of the livestock, milked the cows and the she-goats and this time obtained an unusually large quantity of the richest milk.
CJ|0|252|2|0|When they were finished with this, two of them went on an acre of fully ripened wheat and cut several sheaves and rubbed them until they soon had a heaping basket full of the purest wheat from the cut sheaves.
CJ|0|252|3|0|Then the two other brothers promptly took the basket with the pure wheat, put it into two handgrinders which Joseph had made himself, and in a short time ground up the grain.
CJ|0|252|4|0|And through the Lord's blessing they won twice as much flour as had just been grain in the basket.
CJ|0|252|5|0|Now all this work was completed in three hours. And when the flour stood in two baskets in the sun,
CJ|0|252|6|0|Joseph came outside and asked the sons from whence they had won this beautiful flour.
CJ|0|252|7|0|And when the sons told him how they had won this flour, he looked over the rubbed-out sheaves and asked,
CJ|0|252|8|0|'How is that possible? I see only ten sheaves! Should these really have filled these two large baskets full of flour?'
CJ|0|252|9|0|And the sons answered, 'Yes, father, so it is! By the grace of God we have won this flour in a truly short time from the ten sheaves,
CJ|0|252|10|0|and the blessing of God was on the sheaves and on our work - hence this rich gain!'
CJ|0|252|11|0|Thereupon Joseph gave thanks in utmost humility, went back into the house and told everyone in the house about it.
CJ|0|252|12|0|And all went outside and looked at the flour, and each declared,
CJ|0|252|13|0|'That is impossible, altogether impossible by natural means 1'
CJ|0|252|14|0|Here James in response to an inward prompting picked up a kernel of wheat lying on the ground and said:
CJ|0|252|15|0|'You are all surprised that so much flour came forth from the sheaves.
CJ|0|252|16|0|Now where has any one of us ever been this surprised when he sowed a kernel into the ground and soon saw an hundredfold ear arise out of the one kernel?
CJ|0|252|17|0|And still the first everyday wonder is greater than this double increase in flour, since it multiplies a single kernel an hundredfold!
CJ|0|252|18|0|If the ten rich sheaves had given only one basket full of flour, no one would have been surprised at it, although one basket is as much of a wondrous gift of God as two baskets are.
CJ|0|252|19|0|Thus also no one is surprised at an hundredfold ear, because he is already used to this wonder.
CJ|0|252|20|0|'Now I ask if it is really right to consider God wonderful only there, where He lets something unusual take place, when actually the ordered, usual occurrence is of much greater significance, since it at all times bears constant witness of this same infinite goodness, omnipotence, love and wisdom of God?'
CJ|0|252|21|0|These words of James caused a great sensation. Everyone therefore praised the Lord for having given such wisdom to man. And the sons took the flour and began to prepare a good midday meal.
CJ|0|253|1|1|A Judgment For Wanton Destructiveness
CJ|0|253|1|0|IN AN HOUR a good midday meal was ready, which consisted of five well-prepared fish and fourteen honeycakes,
CJ|0|253|2|0|for the honey was the only thing in the larder which was left by the thieves.
CJ|0|253|3|0|Thus a good drink was also provided, which Joseph and Mary made with water and lemon juice and the addition of some honey.
CJ|0|253|4|0|When the meal was ready and was served on the table, the sons of Joseph remembered to look for the eating utensils, namely knives, forks and spoons, which in Joseph's house were generally made of wood.
CJ|0|253|5|0|But these utensils of no actual value were not spared by the thieves either.
CJ|0|253|6|0|And thus Joseph did indeed have the foods on the table, but not even the most essential eating utensils.
CJ|0|253|7|0|Here Joseph went into the kitchen and asked the sons just what sort of a setting of the table that was,
CJ|0|253|8|0|and how one could be so thoughtless as to put foods on the table without utensils.
CJ|0|253|9|0|But the sons said, 'Father, just look here: one frying pan and two pots and a single old and bent cooking spoon, one knife and one wooden fork have they left us -
CJ|0|253|10|0|everything else they have taken from us; therefore we must leave the milk standing in a single milkpot because all the little cups are also gone.'
CJ|0|253|11|0|When Joseph had convinced himself of all this, he went back into the dining room with the sole cooking spoon and with the one knife and with the one fork and said to Jonathan,
CJ|0|253|12|0|'There, brother! See, these are now our entire cooking utensils. Truly, that is wantonness, and that should be punished!
CJ|0|253|13|0|I can understand a theft of valuable things and a theft when in need.
CJ|0|253|14|0|But with this theft neither one nor the other is the case,
CJ|0|253|15|0|for here criminal wantonness is very evident, and that the Lord should not leave unpunished!'
CJ|0|253|16|0|After this appraisal all sat down at the table, and Joseph cut up the fish with the one knife and placed a portion in front of each one with the one fork and thus also distributed the honeycakes.
CJ|0|253|17|0|And since the little Child did not have His little bowl before Him, He asked Joseph whether the little bowl had also been stolen.
CJ|0|253|18|0|And Mary said, 'Without doubt, my dearest little Son of God, or it would surely be in front of You!'
CJ|0|253|19|0|Hereupon the little Child declared: 'Truly, Joseph is right; that was wantonness, and it shall also be punished at all times and in eternity.
CJ|0|253|20|0|Whoever does evil and does not know it, he shall be taught; as well as he who does so when in need.
CJ|0|253|21|0|But whoever knows the good but still does evil merely for the sake of devilish wantonness, he is a devil from the pit of hell and must be disciplined with fire!'
CJ|0|253|22|0|Thereupon each ate his portion with his bare hand.
CJ|0|253|23|0|And just as they finished eating, a fearful howling was heard outside,
CJ|0|253|24|0|which came from the thieves who had wantonly stolen the necessary kitchen utensils from Joseph's house in order to destroy them.
CJ|0|253|25|0|Each thief was wound about with a glowing serpent and screamed for help, but the little Child did not give ear to them and drove them all, numbering about a hundred, into the sea by His omnipotence, where they all perished. - This was the only time that the little Child showed Himself inexorable.
CJ|0|254|1|1|The Return Of The Stolen Clothes
CJ|0|254|1|0|A SHORT TIME AFTERWARD a howling was again heard some distance away, as if coming from the city, and a number of people were to be seen hastening toward the villa.
CJ|0|254|2|0|'What is going on again now?' Joseph asked of the surprised Jonathan.
CJ|0|254|3|0|And the latter said, 'That, like everything else, the Lord will surely know better than we both.'
CJ|0|254|4|0|And James said to them, 'Do not make much of it, for those are the clothes-thieves!
CJ|0|254|5|0|The Lord's might has caught up with them, and they now are paying for their desecration against the hallowed clothes,
CJ|0|254|6|0|for whoever puts them on or even touches them is immediately seized by an inward, consuming fire.
CJ|0|254|7|0|Therefore they now run about crying and lamenting, and will beg us to take these clothes out of their half-burned houses in the city.
CJ|0|254|8|0|Now we are willing to help them, but the Lord will first warn these evil-doers!'
CJ|0|254|9|0|James hardly finished speaking these words, when the howling clothes-thieves were already at Joseph's door.
CJ|0|254|10|0|There they cried mightily for help and deliverance, whereupon Joseph went outside, accompanied by Jonathan.
CJ|0|254|11|0|When he came out, thirty despairing men cried to him,
CJ|0|254|12|0|'You almighty god Jupiter, help us and save us, for we have blasphemed against you, since we did not recognize you!
CJ|0|254|13|0|But now we have recognized you; so we beg you, kill us, or get the clothes belonging to your house out of our houses!'
CJ|0|254|14|0|Here the little Child came outside and warned: 'Listen, you wicked thieves!
CJ|0|254|15|0|As you have taken the clothes, so also bring them back here again.
CJ|0|254|16|0|If you do not do that, death shall be your lot!'
CJ|0|254|17|0|When the thieves heard this, they cried,
CJ|0|254|18|0|'That is the young God, Him we must obey or we are lost!'
CJ|0|254|19|0|Then they all suddenly ran away and brought back all the stolen clothes on iron rods,
CJ|0|254|20|0|for none could touch these clothes with their bare hands.
CJ|0|254|21|0|When the clothes were returned, the little Child let the thieves go and did not punish them any further. Here Joseph joyfully took the clothes back and carried them into the house.
CJ|0|255|1|1|The Inward Nobility Of Mary
CJ|0|255|1|0|WHEN MARY saw her clothes again she was indeed glad, but at the same time she felt compassion toward those who had returned her clothes -
CJ|0|255|2|0|for she thought by herself: These have surely not received anything of the gold, therefore they took the poor clothes in their need.
CJ|0|255|3|0|Now they will probably be faced with great poverty.
CJ|0|255|4|0|Oh if they were only here, I would gladly give them the clothes or enough money so they could obtain clothing with it for themselves.
CJ|0|255|5|0|Here the little Child went over to Mary and said,
CJ|0|255|6|0|'Why mother, how beautiful you are today! - If you knew how beautiful you are, you could easily become vain!'
CJ|0|255|7|0|Here Mary smiled and asked the little One who was caressing her,
CJ|0|255|8|0|'Oh my dearest Jesus! Am I then not equally beautiful every day?'
CJ|0|255|9|0|And the little Child answered, 'Oh yes, you are always very beautiful indeed; but sometimes you are still a little more beautiful.
CJ|0|255|10|0|And today you are quite especially beautiful! - Truly, you are now surrounded by a thousand archangels, and each one wants to be the closest to you!'
CJ|0|255|11|0|Now Mary did not understand the words of the little Child and looked round about, whether any archangel was to be seen.
CJ|0|255|12|0|But she discerned nothing except what was in the room and therefore asked the little Child,
CJ|0|255|13|0|'Well, where then are the thousand archangels, since I am unable to see even one?'
CJ|0|255|14|0|Here the little Child replied: 'You cannot be permitted to see one because you might become vain!
CJ|0|255|15|0|But you are now so beautiful before all the angels of the heavens because such a great feeling of pity for the sufferings of others has arisen in your heart that it is nearly equal to Mine!
CJ|0|255|16|0|'See, to bring a just and humane penance on one's enemies is fitting and proper, and shall always be so on earth -
CJ|0|255|17|0|but to wholeheartedly forgive one's enemies their guilt and in addition do them good and bless them, see, that is purely divine!
CJ|0|255|18|0|That can only be accomplished by the infinite power of divine love;
CJ|0|255|19|0|for human love is too weak for that!
CJ|0|255|20|0|And because you have just done this as God does it, you are now so beautiful, for God is the above all greatest beauty as well as the highest love.
CJ|0|255|21|0|And now go and do what your heart desires, and My kingdom of love will become your own like a royal inheritance and you will be a queen therein forever!'
CJ|0|255|22|0|Here Mary promptly sent Jonathan after the thieves, whereupon he brought them back, and Mary richly meted out to them the money which Jonathan had given to her as well as to Joseph.
CJ|0|256|1|1|Joseph Reproves The Eminent Citizens
CJ|0|256|1|0|THIS ACT OF DIVINE LOVE caused the thieves to fall on their faces and cry out:
CJ|0|256|2|0|'Such kindness, such generosity is never a trait of men; only the gods who never die can still reward their enemies!
CJ|0|256|3|0|We deserved only punishment here for our great sin against you high gods,
CJ|0|256|4|0|but instead of punishing us as we deserved, you reward and bless us for our evil deeds!
CJ|0|256|5|0|Does that not make you gods? Yes, you are without doubt the highest lords of the heavens - for your deeds, the like of which we have never seen, bear witness to that!
CJ|0|256|6|0|Therefore honor, praise and glory to you by all people on earth!
CJ|0|256|7|0|And the power of all the princes of the earth shall bow eternally before your great splendor!'
CJ|0|256|8|0|Hereupon the thieves arose and went away filled with gratitude and esteem
CJ|0|256|9|0|and made this known in the whole city; and all the inhabitants quaked at such nearness of the gods and went furtively about and did not dare to work from sheer awe.
CJ|0|256|10|0|Soon thereafter the eminent citizens of Ostracine came to Joseph and asked him whether the story was really true which the mob was now shouting about in the half-burned city.
CJ|0|256|11|0|And Joseph answered, 'As concerns the good deed toward them, their shouting is correct;
CJ|0|256|12|0|for thus my wife did in fact act against them.
CJ|0|256|13|0|But that they hold us to be gods is a bad testimony for you who are great and wealthy.
CJ|0|256|14|0|For thereby the poor mob characterizes your extreme hardheartedness, since it sees nothing akin to godliness about you!
CJ|0|256|15|0|Do as my wife did, and as my whole house does, and the mob will soon cease to hold the inhabitants of my house for gods!'
CJ|0|256|16|0|When the high and mighty of the city heard this to them very applicable talk of Joseph, they were greatly embarrassed and went their way.
CJ|0|256|17|0|And they were convinced that Joseph was merely an above all wise and good man, but for all that no god.
CJ|0|256|18|0|From then on Joseph's house was left in peace.
CJ|0|256|19|0|And his family lived there another half year without being molested and was respected and esteemed by everyone.
CJ|0|256|20|0|During this time the little Child worked no more wonders and everyone lived there quite naturally. And Jonathan was more with Joseph than at home; for here was for him a most blessed existence.
CJ|0|257|1|1|The Departure From Egypt
CJ|0|257|1|0|ABOUT THIS TIME the child slayer Herod died, and his son Archelaus succeeded him to the throne.
CJ|0|257|2|0|This James told to Joseph and to Mary.
CJ|0|257|3|0|Hereupon Joseph asked James, 'I believe you; but how is that supposed to affect me?'
CJ|0|257|4|0|And James replied, 'That, father, the Lord did not give me to tell you;
CJ|0|257|5|0|but as the Lord heretofore has always shown you His will through the mouth of an angel, so will He also do now.
CJ|0|257|6|0|For it would not be in the divine order that a son should dictate to his father what ways he should take!'
CJ|0|257|7|0|Here Joseph asked, 'Do you really suppose that the Lord will do this with me?'
CJ|0|257|8|0|And James said, 'Father, this is the way I just heard it within me:
CJ|0|257|9|0|Even tonight I shall send My angel to you in a lucid dream, who will make My will known to you.
CJ|0|257|10|0|And as he will declare it to you, so also shall you act promptly according to his word!'
CJ|0|257|11|0|When Joseph heard this from James, he went outside and prayed to God and thanked Him for such advance knowledge through the mouth of his son James.
CJ|0|257|12|0|Joseph continued long in prayer and only after three hours did he go into the house and to rest.
CJ|0|257|13|0|And as he slept on his couch, giving his labor-weary limbs rest, there appeared to him in a dream the angel of the Lord and said to him:
CJ|0|257|14|0|'Arise, take the little Child and His mother, and go over into the land of Israel; for they who sought after the life of the little Child have died!'
CJ|0|257|15|0|When Joseph heard this, he quickly arose and made this known to Mary.
CJ|0|257|16|0|And Mary said, 'The Lord's will be done ever and always!
CJ|0|257|17|0|But how is it that you speak only of us three?' Are your children then to remain here?'
CJ|0|257|18|0|And Joseph answered, 'Oh not at all, for what the angel said to me naturally includes my whole house!
CJ|0|257|19|0|For thus the Lord also spoke to the prophets as if He were dealing with them alone -
CJ|0|257|20|0|but just the same the Lord's words always concerned the whole house of Jacob.'
CJ|0|257|21|0|These words were understood by all, and the sons promptly went outside to put everything in order for the departure.
CJ|0|257|22|0|But they returned full of surprise; for everything was already prepared for the departure, and for each person a fully packed donkey was ready with all the essential needs for the journey.
CJ|0|257|23|0|Joseph gave everything that remained to Jonathan, who was present here this night, then blessed him and told him to come to Nazareth in a year.
CJ|0|257|24|0|And the little Child also blessed him and kissed him. Jonathan wept at this sudden departure.
CJ|0|257|25|0|And Joseph mounted the pack animals still long before sunrise and thereupon made his departure by land.
CJ|0|258|1|1|The Return To Nazareth
CJ|0|258|1|0|AFTER TEN ARDUOUS DAYS of travel, Joseph with his family arrived safely in the land of Israel, where they rested on a hill with a few people who dwelt there and earned their livelihood by raising cattle.
CJ|0|258|2|0|Here Joseph made close inquiries about all conditions in his homeland.
CJ|0|258|3|0|But when he heard from these people that Archelaus now reigned after his father Herod
CJ|0|258|4|0|and that he was still more cruel than his father, a great fear came over Joseph and all of his family.
CJ|0|258|5|0|And he thought to turn back and journey to Egypt again - or instead to Tyre.
CJ|0|258|6|0|For although, while in Egypt, he had learned by the mouth of James that Archelaus now reigned in Jerusalem,
CJ|0|258|7|0|he had not heard that this king actually exceeded his father in cruelty.
CJ|0|258|8|0|And it was this news which made Joseph so fearful that he wanted to turn back again at once.
CJ|0|258|9|0|Mary did indeed speak to him and ask,
CJ|0|258|10|0|'Joseph! It was the Lord Himself who told us to go; why should we fear the human king Archelaus more than the Lord?'
CJ|0|258|11|0|Joseph replied. 'Oh Mary, my dearly beloved wife, your question cannot be denied:
CJ|0|258|12|0|but I also know that the ways of the Lord are often truly incomprehensible, and that He often leads His own through death - beginning with Abel.
CJ|0|258|13|0|Therefore I now fear that the Lord will lead me through death also.
CJ|0|258|14|0|And the more I consider the cruelty of this new king in Jerusalem, the more probable does this possibility appear to me.
CJ|0|258|15|0|On that account I have also decided to turn back again tomorrow morning.
CJ|0|258|16|0|Truly, if the Lord has our death in mind, then let Him rather send lions, tigers and hyenas over us that Archelaus!'
CJ|0|258|17|0|Thus Joseph firmly decided to turn back.
CJ|0|258|18|0|But during the night the Spirit of the Lord came over Joseph in a dream.
CJ|0|258|19|0|and Joseph received the order from God Himself to go to Nazareth.
CJ|0|258|20|0|Thereupon Joseph promptly arose and went his way very early.
CJ|0|258|21|0|And that very day he came into the little towns of the land of Galilee.
CJ|0|258|22|0|And late that night he came to the town of Nazareth where he took permanent residence, so the word of the prophet would be fulfilled, which states: He shall be called a Nazarene!
CJ|0|259|1|1|Cornelius Discovers The Little Caravan
CJ|0|259|1|0|NOW WHERE did Joseph live-in Nazareth? Where did he dismount and where did he enter?
CJ|0|259|2|0|It was told in the early chapters which dealt with Joseph's departure from Bethlehem for Egypt that Joseph had asked the wealthy Salome in Bethlehem to lease his little farmstead by Nazareth for him.
CJ|0|259|3|0|Did Salome do this? - Yes. she not only did what Joseph asked, but also bought the little farmstead for herself with this double intent:
CJ|0|259|4|0|In the event Joseph or a child of his should ever return, to give them full possession of the property:
CJ|0|259|5|0|but otherwise to keep this so highly venerated place for herself in memory of the exalted family.
CJ|0|259|6|0|She considered this place to be such a shrine that she did not feel free to live in it herself; and still less did she take renters into it.
CJ|0|259|7|0|But so she could live close to this property, she bought a neighboring acre in addition and there built a quite attractive little house wherein she dwelt with her servants and was occasionally visited there by Cornelius.
CJ|0|259|8|0|And it just so happened this day that Cornelius, while on his way back from official duties, paid a visit to Salome at the time Joseph returned to Nazareth.
CJ|0|259|9|0|It was a glorious evening, the moon was full, and not a cloud dimmed the least little star in the sky.
CJ|0|259|10|0|This beautiful evening drew Salome and Cornelius to the roof of her attractive little house which sat fairly close to the main road and directly faced Joseph's little farmstead toward the east at a distance of about seventy fathoms.
CJ|0|259|11|0|Both often looked toward the erstwhile dwelling place of the holy family, and Cornelius, as he had done several times before, said to Salome,
CJ|0|259|12|0|'I still see the occasion in Bethlehem before me vividly as if in a very beautiful and exalted dream, and this farmstead constantly reminds me of it.
CJ|0|259|13|0|But more than that, the occasion in Bethlehem was of such wondrous grandeur that it constantly becomes more enigmatical to me the more I think about it.'
CJ|0|259|14|0|And Salome said, 'Yes, friend Cornelius! I too cannot grasp how I was able to stay alive at the greatness of that occurrence.
CJ|0|259|15|0|But that is the difference between me and you that I now, as you know, cannot help myself and must always worship the Child in my heart,
CJ|0|259|16|0|while you look upon the whole matter more as sublime history.
CJ|0|259|17|0|Therefore I have pictured it in my spirit a number of times as follows: if this family should ever come here again, I could not live for happiness.
CJ|0|259|18|0|If they lived over there on the little farm - oh God, what a feeling that would give me!
CJ|0|259|19|0|Truly, the highest heavens would then be together on this roof!'
CJ|0|259|20|0|Cornelius agreed, 'Yes, you are right, that would also be a most exalting experience for me.
CJ|0|259|21|0|But what would we do now, if - I make the supposition - this truly exalted, divine family came along, and we recognized them from a distance?'
CJ|0|259|22|0|At this Salome declared, 'Oh friend! Do not speak of that - that would kill me for joy!'
CJ|0|259|23|0|While the two were thus conversing on the roof in a manner pleasing to God and it had already become quite late,
CJ|0|259|24|0|Cornelius noticed a procession like a little caravan at a distance of about two hundred fathoms, and said to Salome,
CJ|0|259|25|0|'Just look over there, a migration still late at night! Do you suppose they are Greeks or Jews?
CJ|0|259|26|0|Salome, what would you do now if that were none other than the most exalted family?'
CJ|0|259|27|0|Salome was altogether frightened at this and objected, 'Now I beg you, do not always talk about it and do not always renew wishes in me which cannot be fulfilled!
CJ|0|259|28|0|What then would you do on such a most joyful occasion?'
CJ|0|259|29|0|Here Cornelius replied, 'Truly, I too would fare badly! But look, the caravan comes to a stop, and I see one of its members hurry directly toward us. Come, let us see who he is!'
CJ|0|259|30|0|And they went to meet the man. Now the man was a son of Joseph who went with a jug to get water from the house.
CJ|0|259|31|0|But neither of them recognized him, for thus the Lord wanted it for the sake of their well-being.
CJ|0|260|1|1|On The Outskirts Of Nazareth
CJ|0|260|1|0|WHEN JOEL had dipped the water, he asked the two how far it still was to Nazareth.
CJ|0|260|2|0|And Cornelius replied, 'My friend, look over there, and you can easily see the walls of the town.
CJ|0|260|3|0|A child can easily reach them in a quarter hour, therefore you are now as good as in Nazareth itself.'
CJ|0|260|4|0|Joel thanked them for this information and carried the water to his people.
CJ|0|260|5|0|When he arrived there, Joseph promptly asked him what he had learned at the little house.
CJ|0|260|6|0|Joel replied, 'A woman and a man came toward me in a very friendly manner, gave me water and told me that we had already reached the town of Nazareth.
CJ|0|260|7|0|Thereupon I thought, if that is the town, then we surely do not have far to go to our farmstead.'
CJ|0|260|8|0|Here Joseph said, 'My dear son, therein you are no doubt right;
CJ|0|260|9|0|but do you know to whom it now belongs after three years?
CJ|0|260|10|0|May we move into our former dwelling?
CJ|0|260|11|0|See, therefore we must spend the night here beneath the open sky and wait until tomorrow to see where a permanent dwelling place may be found for us.
CJ|0|260|12|0|Now go with your brothers and see if you can get a little wood and fire somewhere.
CJ|0|260|13|0|For it is a little cool here among the hills at the elevation of this valley; therefore we must make a fire here so we may warm ourselves a little by it.'
CJ|0|260|14|0|Thereupon the four sons returned to the same little house and found the two still there.
CJ|0|260|15|0|At this they made their desire known to Salome and asked for a little wood and a fire.
CJ|0|260|16|0|Here Salome as well as Cornelius asked just who the group was and whether it could really be trusted.
CJ|0|260|17|0|The sons answered, 'We come from Egypt and place honesty above all else.
CJ|0|260|18|0|We seek to purchase some sort of dwelling for ourselves here in Nazareth;
CJ|0|260|19|0|for we are originally Nazarenes ourselves, but were exiled to Egypt by unavoidable circumstances for three years.
CJ|0|260|20|0|Now our exile is over, therefore we have returned to find ourselves a place to live.'
CJ|0|260|21|0|When the pair heard this from the returnees they promptly gave them sufficient wood and fire, which the sons carried to Joseph.
CJ|0|260|22|0|At this Joseph promptly had a fire made and all warmed themselves thereby.
CJ|0|261|1|1|Salome And Cornelius Recognize The Family
CJ|0|261|1|0|SALOME AND CORNELIUS now considered back and forth just who this group from Egypt might really be.
CJ|0|261|2|0|Cornelius said,'It seems to me that these four men, who seem to be rather young, have a strong resemblance to the sons of that remarkable man with whom we both associated in Bethlehem.
CJ|0|261|3|0|Their speech also has an unmistakable Nazarene ring.
CJ|0|261|4|0|Listen, my esteemed lady friend! This remarkable man, who was named Joseph, very probably emigrated to Egypt, as I have heard in a letter from my brother in Tyre.
CJ|0|261|5|0|How - what if that were the same Joseph?
CJ|0|261|6|0|Should we therefore not go over to these people and look at them more closely? And if they are the right ones,
CJ|0|261|7|0|should we not promptly show them the most elaborate hospitality?'
CJ|0|261|8|0|When Salome heard this, she nearly fainted from ecstasy and declared,
CJ|0|261|9|0|'Oh friend, you are surely right - it must be true and that is surely the holy family!
CJ|0|261|10|0|Therefore I shall quickly awaken my servants so they can go with us to where this family rests!'
CJ|0|261|11|0|Thereupon Salome went and awakened all her servants.
CJ|0|261|12|0|In a short time everyone in Salome's house was on his feet,
CJ|0|261|13|0|and when all were ready to leave, Cornelius said to Salome,
CJ|0|261|14|0|'Now let us go there and see who this family is.'
CJ|0|261|15|0|Thereupon Salome quickly called everyone in the house together, and the whole company went over to where Joseph rested by a moderate fire.
CJ|0|261|16|0|When they arrived there, Cornelius asserted to Salome,
CJ|0|261|17|0|'Just look over there! There beside the fire - is that not the young Mary, the wife of Joseph with her Child?
CJ|0|261|18|0|And yonder old man, say, is he not Joseph, that remarkable man with whom we became acquainted in Bethlehem?'
CJ|0|261|19|0|Here Salome opened her eyes wide and stared and slowly recognized what Cornelius pointed out to her.
CJ|0|261|20|0|But that was too much for Salome! She sank down and fainted, and Cornelius had his hands full to bring his companion on her feet again.
CJ|0|262|1|1|Joseph Returns To His Farmstead
CJ|0|262|1|0|WHEN SALOME recovered from her ecstatic faint, she said to Cornelius,
CJ|0|262|2|0|'Oh friend, just let me rest a little while, and I will go over and tell this holy family about my preservation of their little farmstead!'
CJ|0|262|3|0|Cornelius answered, 'Listen, if you feel too weak, then let me go over in your name and tell the family what you have done for them.
CJ|0|262|4|0|See, there is not time to be lost here. These eminent travelers must be very tired and need a good lodging very soon; therefore I will promptly go over in your name.'
CJ|0|262|5|0|When Salome heard this from Cornelius, she said,
CJ|0|262|6|0|'Oh friend, you are right; but I have pulled myself together now and will promptly go over with you!'
CJ|0|262|7|0|After this resolve both went over to the group.
CJ|0|262|8|0|Cornelius now acted as spokesman, saying, 'The Lord God of Israel is with you, as also with me and my companion Salome!
CJ|0|262|9|0|I succeeded in recognizing you, and there now is no more doubt that you, old and upright man, are the same Joseph - along with the young wife Mary - who three years ago journeyed to Egypt to escape the persecution of Herod.
CJ|0|262|10|0|I have therefore hastened here to promptly receive you and lead you to your property.'
CJ|0|262|11|0|When Joseph heard this from Cornelius, he arose and asked him,
CJ|0|262|12|0|'Good man, who are you, that you may impart this to me?
CJ|0|262|13|0|Announce your name to me, and I will promptly follow you!'
CJ|0|262|14|0|And Cornelius replied,'Most worthy old man! See, I am the prefect of Jerusalem,
CJ|0|262|15|0|my name is Cornelius, and I am the same who in Bethlehem rendered you a small kindness.
CJ|0|262|16|0|So do not concern yourself with anything else, for my lady friend here, Salome of Bethlehem, has faithfully carried out your request.'
CJ|0|262|17|0|Here Salome threw herself at Joseph's feet and declared in a trembling voice,
CJ|0|262|18|0|'Joy to me, a poor sinner, that my unworthy eyes behold you again!
CJ|0|262|19|0|Oh come, come into your house. For my house is not worthy of such grace!'
CJ|0|262|20|0|At this Joseph was stirred to tears and said,
CJ|0|262|21|0|'O great God and Father, how good You are! Truly, You always lead the weary traveler to the best place.'
CJ|0|262|22|0|Thereupon he embraced Cornelius and Salome and promptly went with them to his little farmstead.
CJ|0|263|1|1|The Child Praises Salome's Love
CJ|0|263|1|0|THE SERVANTS of Salome and the aides of Cornelius and Salome and Cornelius themselves helped expedite all of Joseph's belongings.
CJ|0|263|2|0|Salome then led the group into the well furnished rooms of the homestead.
CJ|0|263|3|0|Joseph was greatly surprised at the great cleanliness which was kept in his house,
CJ|0|263|4|0|for all the beds were clean and freshly made; and the stable was also kept in the best order.
CJ|0|263|5|0|When Joseph had assured himself of how excellently Salome had provided for him in every way,
CJ|0|263|6|0|he asked her, 'Oh dear lady friend, you can plainly see that I am poor and do not have the least wealth now. How will I ever be able to repay you?'
CJ|0|263|7|0|When Salome heard this question from Joseph, she said weeping,
CJ|0|263|8|0|'Oh my truly esteemed friend! What indeed do I have, in this world which I did not receive from Him who now rests on the arms of the frail Mary?
CJ|0|263|9|0|And since it is forever true that I have received everything from Him who is with you in such an eternally marvelous way, how could I call that mine which always belonged to Him who is with you?
CJ|0|263|10|0|Oh the Lord, the Holy One from eternity, surely did not come into a strange land to us poor sinners;
CJ|0|263|11|0|instead He came into His very own from eternity - therefore we can give Him nothing.
CJ|0|263|12|0|Instead we bring Him only what belongs to Him with the strength which He has given us-
CJ|0|263|13|0|and thus every mention of a debt to me on your part is forever void, for I have already been rewarded for all eternity through the grace of the infinite, most high calling to provide for you -
CJ|0|263|14|0|and that all the more, since I feel it in the whole depth of my life that I am surely the least worthy of this holy calling!'
CJ|0|263|15|0|Here Salome could not continue speaking, so she was silent and wept in her love and joy.
CJ|0|263|16|0|At this moment the little Child awakened and became lively.
CJ|0|263|17|0|And when in a gay mood He had righted Himself on Mary's lap, He looked lovingly over toward Salome and toward Cornelius and said,
CJ|0|263|18|0|'Oh Salome, and you too, My Cornelius! See, I was asleep, but your great love has awakened Me!
CJ|0|263|19|0|Truly, that is sweet and pleasant, and thus it shall remain forever!
CJ|0|263|20|0|From now on I will sleep for everyone in my divine Essence - but whoever will come to Me with your love, for him I will remain awake forever!
CJ|0|263|21|0|Salome, go to your rest now, and bring me a good breakfast tomorrow.'
CJ|0|263|22|0|And Salome was thoroughly enchanted that she had thus heard the Lord speak for the first time. All now honored and praised God and then retired.
CJ|0|264|1|1|Salome Prepares The Child's Favorite Food
CJ|0|264|1|0|VERY EARLY the next morning everyone in both houses had already arisen, and Salome was busy in her kitchen preparing a good breakfast of honeycakes, a tasty fish broth and several select fish,
CJ|0|264|2|0|among which the trout, which were often caught there in the mountain streams, were really the best.
CJ|0|264|3|0|When breakfast was ready, Salome hastened into the house of Joseph and invited Joseph and all the members of his household to breakfast.
CJ|0|264|4|0|At this Joseph objected, 'But my dear lady friend, why do you go to so much trouble because of me?
CJ|0|264|5|0|See, my sons also are already busy in the kitchen and are preparing an early meal;
CJ|0|264|6|0|so you really could have spared your kind hospitality.'
CJ|0|264|7|0|But Salome replied, 'Oh my truly esteemed friend! Please do not disdain the work of your handmaiden, and come.'
CJ|0|264|8|0|Here Joseph was deeply moved, called everyone in his house together and went with Salome to her house for breakfast.
CJ|0|264|9|0|At the doorstep Cornelius awaited them and welcomed them all in the most heartfelt manner.
CJ|0|264|10|0|And Joseph was filled with joy because he fully recognized his friend Cornelius again in the sunlight.
CJ|0|264|11|0|All now went into the attractive dining room where the breakfast awaited the guests.
CJ|0|264|12|0|And when the little Child beheld the fish on the table, He smiled, ran over to Salome and said to her,
CJ|0|264|13|0|'But whoever told you that I like to eat fish?
CJ|0|264|14|0|There you have really made Me very happy, for that is above all my favorite dish.
CJ|0|264|15|0|I do of course also like to eat the honeycakes, as well as the fish-broth with wheat bread;
CJ|0|264|16|0|but I still would rather have the fish than any of the other foods.
CJ|0|264|17|0|So it was very thoughtful of you to be so concerned for Me, and I now love you for it quite especially!'
CJ|0|264|18|0|At this praise from the little Child Salome again was beside herself with joy and wept.
CJ|0|264|19|0|Here the little Child said, 'Salome, see, it seems that you always weep when you are very happy about something;
CJ|0|264|20|0|but you see, I am no friend of weeping. Therefore you must not always weep when something makes you happy, and I will be more fond of you still. -
CJ|0|264|21|0|See, I really would like to eat the fish while sitting on your lap;
CJ|0|264|22|0|but I just do not trust Myself to sit there, because you might weep entirely too much from all your joy!'
CJ|0|264|23|0|Here Salome pulled herself together as much as she could and said to the little Child,
CJ|0|264|24|0|'O Lord! Who indeed can behold You without tears in his eyes?'
CJ|0|264|25|0|And the little Child answered, 'Just look at My brothers here, they also see Me daily and still do not weep when they see Me!'
CJ|0|264|26|0|Thereupon Salome was calm again, and everyone went to the table where the little Child took His place on Salome's lap.
CJ|0|265|1|1|Cornelius Becalms Joseph's Fears
CJ|0|265|1|0|WHEN THE BREAKFAST was over, Joseph conferred with Cornelius concerning King Archelaus and inquired closely as to what sort of man he was, and how he ruled.
CJ|0|265|2|0|And Cornelius said to Joseph, 'Truly exalted man and friend! If I and my brother Cyrenius did not keep him from digressing, he would be ten times more cruel than his father was.
CJ|0|265|3|0|But as it is we have greatly curbed his power for good reasons, and thus he may do nothing except only to collect his taxes, and that according to our estimate.
CJ|0|265|4|0|And if those liable to taxation should for any reason refuse to pay the taxes he must refer the matter to us,
CJ|0|265|5|0|failing which we can at any time give him the emperor's dethronement document, which I always have at hand, and then declare him without power before the people.
CJ|0|265|6|0|So you need not have the least fear of this king;
CJ|0|265|7|0|for it just is not expedient for him to ever act against the existing statutes in any way,
CJ|0|265|8|0|or tomorrow he is not a king any more, but instead a despised, powerless slave of Rome!
CJ|0|265|9|0|Friend, I would say that you do not need any more for your peace of mind.
CJ|0|265|10|0|'I am now the prefect of Jerusalem, and my brother Cyrenius is, so to speak, the vice-emperor of Asia and Africa, and we are your friends.
CJ|0|265|11|0|I believe that, speaking in a worldly sense, a better guarantee probably cannot be had by anyone in any country.
CJ|0|265|12|0|And the by far greatest guarantee for your peace and safety surely dwells in your house!
CJ|0|265|13|0|So do not worry now in the least, and follow your to me already known calling without timidity or fear.
CJ|0|265|14|0|And when the taxes are determined, I shall be sure to select a column that will not hurt your!'
CJ|0|265|15|0|When Joseph heard this from Cornelius, he was restored to his usual happy and tranquil mood.
CJ|0|265|16|0|Cornelius now discovered the five girls of Cyrenius, and also Eudokia, who seemed to be quite well-known to him but whom he did not recognize here.
CJ|0|265|17|0|He therefore asked Joseph concerning the particular circumstances of these girls.
CJ|0|265|18|0|And Joseph told him everything according to the facts without any false modesty.
CJ|0|265|19|0|When Cornelius thus learned how generously and most unselfishly Joseph acted toward his brother Cyrenius,
CJ|0|265|20|0|it made him so happy that he kissed Joseph, then called his brother's children over to himself and caressed and kissed them also.
CJ|0|265|21|0|He then assured Joseph, 'Because you act thus toward my brother, you shall also be tax-free for all time, like every citizen of Rome; and today I shall fasten the emperor's charter on your house myself!' - And Joseph was very happy thereat, as well as all those present.
CJ|0|266|1|1|The Secret Writing Of The Romans
CJ|0|266|1|0|AFTER THIS CORNELIUS also asked Joseph whether Cyrenius already knew that Joseph had left Egypt,
CJ|0|266|2|0|and if not, whether he should not be fully informed of this at once for reasons of state.
CJ|0|266|3|0|And Joseph replied, 'Friend, act toward your brother as you wish;
CJ|0|266|4|0|but I would really ask you to tell him in any event not to visit me too soon.
CJ|0|266|5|0|But if he really wishes to come, then have him come under cover of darkness so no one will notice his presence with me,
CJ|0|266|6|0|and my house will not attract any most undesirable attention because of it, which would be harmful to me and the Child and could have a disturbing effect on the divine peace of my house!'
CJ|0|266|7|0|When Cornelius heard this from Joseph, he assured him,
CJ|0|266|8|0|'oh my venerable friend, do not concern yourself there! For in the matter of sending a message to someone strictly incognito we Romans are masters;
CJ|0|266|9|0|and as soon as I arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow my first business, of which no one shall know, will be to inform my brother by means of a secret document that you are here.
CJ|0|266|10|0|With such a document I would send Archelaus himself to my brother, if it came to that, and he would not know what is written thereon even though the writing were in his hands unsealed!'
CJ|0|266|11|0|Here Joseph asked Cornelius how such a secret writing were possible.
CJ|0|266|12|0|And Cornelius answered, 'Oh venerable friend! Nothing is easier than that.
CJ|0|266|13|0|See, one takes a long strip of parchment about a finger wide,
CJ|0|266|14|0|and wraps this strip spirally about a round staff so the edges exactly touch each other.
CJ|0|266|15|0|Once the strip is thus wholly wound over the round staff, one then writes his secret along the length of the staff across all the windings of the strip of parchment.
CJ|0|266|16|0|Now Cyrenius also has a staff of exactly the same thickness as mine.
CJ|0|266|17|0|Once I have finished the document, it is unrolled from the staff and sent quite openly to my brother through someone -
CJ|0|266|18|0|and no one is then capable of even remotely deciphering contents of such a document without an identical staff,
CJ|0|266|19|0|for he discovers nothing on the strip except mostly single letters and at most syllables, which are certain not to make any sense to him in eternity as concerns the writing on the strip. - Joseph, did you understand me?'
CJ|0|266|20|0|And Joseph said, 'Quite perfectly, my very dear brother!
CJ|0|266|21|0|So you may as well write to your brother, for thus the secret will surely not be deciphered by anyone!'
CJ|0|266|22|0|Thereupon Cornelius turned to Eudokia and discussed various matters with her.
CJ|0|267|1|1|The Child's Promise To Cornelius
CJ|0|267|1|0|WHEN CORNELIUS had sufficiently discussed everything with Eudokia which he felt he should know,
CJ|0|267|2|0|and saw therefrom that her statements were in perfect agreement with the letter from his brother,
CJ|0|267|3|0|he turned to Joseph again and said to him,
CJ|0|267|4|0|'Venerated man! Now I am altogether in the clear in everything.
CJ|0|267|5|0|I do not want to ask you how and why you left Egypt again even though you were provided there with everything in every way;
CJ|0|267|6|0|for I know that you do not do otherwise than your God commands you to do.
CJ|0|267|7|0|And since you act thus exactly according to the will of your God, so also are your actions always good and just before God and that part of the world which thinks, wills and acts according to established law as I do.
CJ|0|267|8|0|'But I still would like to ask you about one thing before my departure to Jerusalem,
CJ|0|267|9|0|which is this: See, I still see before me all of the wondrous manifestations which took place at your Child's birth as if they just happened.
CJ|0|267|10|0|But now I see that this so miraculous quality seems to have wholly disappeared from Him. Tell me, how is that to be understood?'
CJ|0|267|11|0|And Joseph answered, 'Oh friend, how can you ask so strangely there?
CJ|0|267|12|0|Did you not hear the Child speak with Salome a little while ago?
CJ|0|267|13|0|Do all children of men speak with such depth of wisdom at this age?
CJ|0|267|14|0|Do you not find such speech from the mouth of a three-year-old Child just as remarkable as each manifestation at the birth in Bethlehem?'
CJ|0|267|15|0|Here Cornelius said, 'There you are no doubt right - but as far as that goes, this wonder is nothing new to me.
CJ|0|267|16|0|You see, on several occasions in Rome I have already heard children who were one year old and who were born under quite ordinary circumstances say truly remarkable things!
CJ|0|267|17|0|For that reason your extraordinary Child has not fulfilled my great expectations here.'
CJ|0|267|18|0|At this the little Child came to Cornelius and said to him,
CJ|0|267|19|0|'Cornelius, be satisfied with the burden which I have placed upon your shoulders;
CJ|0|267|20|0|for you would have to become a mountain of granite if you wanted to load a larger burden of My will up on your shoulders!
CJ|0|267|21|0|So do not ask more of Me before the proper time.
CJ|0|267|22|0|And at the right time I shall surely do enough for you and for all the world!'
CJ|0|267|23|0|When Cornelius heard this, he inquired no more and soon thereafter had his belongings put in order for his departure.
CJ|0|268|1|1|Joseph's House Receives A Roman Charter
CJ|0|268|1|0|IN TWO HOURS Cornelius was ready for the journey but in the meantime he went with Joseph to the latter's house where he, as promised, affixed a little iron plaque with the emperor's picture and name to the door.
CJ|0|268|2|0|This little plaque was the imperial symbol of immunity or the same as a charter according to which the king of that particular country holding a Roman tenure was not permitted to exercise any right over such a house.
CJ|0|268|3|0|When Cornelius finished with this task, he took his stylus and wrote on the door underneath the plaque in the Roman language,
CJ|0|268|4|0|'Tabulam hanc libertatis Romanae secundum judicum Caesaris Augusti suamque volun-tatem affigit Cornelius Archidux Hierosolymae in plena potestate urbis Romae.'
CJ|0|268|5|0|When Cornelius also finished this inscription, he said to Joseph,
CJ|0|268|6|0|'Now, my esteemed friend, your house and your calling are free from any sort of tax which Archelaus might levy upon you.
CJ|0|268|7|0|You need only see to the payment of the yearly denarius as tribute to Rome, which it is to be hoped you will easily be able to spare!
CJ|0|268|8|0|This denarius you can deposit either in Jerusalem itself or also here in Nazareth at the imperial office, which will give you a receipt.
CJ|0|268|9|0|And thus you are now freed from all persecutions on the part of the tenure king; but affix a little grating over the plaque so no one will steal it from you and spoil my signature!'
CJ|0|268|10|0|Joseph thanked the Lord God in his heart for so much grace and blessed Cornelius therefor.
CJ|0|268|11|0|Here the little Child also went over to Cornelius and said to him:
CJ|0|268|12|0|'Now listen to Me a little, for I want to tell you something also as a great reward!
CJ|0|268|13|0|See, you now have done the house of Joseph a great kindness;
CJ|0|268|14|0|and I shall, in days to come, also do in like manner to your whole house!
CJ|0|268|15|0|Even if this house is not the property of my foster father, but only the property of Salome because she has bought it,
CJ|0|268|16|0|just the same I shall make good many times on your very own house what you have done for this house of Salome.
CJ|0|268|17|0|You have fastened the imperial symbol of immunity to the door of the house with your own hand and have added your signature to it.
CJ|0|268|18|0|So also shall I, in days to come, spread out My Spirit over your whole house, through which you will receive the eternal freedom of the heavens of God and with it the eternal, imperishable life in My kingdom!'
CJ|0|268|19|0|Here Cornelius picked up the little Child and kissed Him and smiled at His strange promise;
CJ|0|268|20|0|for how could he actually have understood what the little Child had spoken to him in such divine depth of wisdom?
CJ|0|268|21|0|And the little Child said: 'You will understand that only when My Spirit will come over you!' - Thereupon the little Child ran over to His James again. Cornelius now took his leave, and Joseph began to order everything in the house according to his needs.
CJ|0|269|1|1|Joseph Decides To Visit Friends And Relatives
CJ|0|269|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH, with the active help of Salome, had put everything in his house in good order on this day, he thanked God and was full of joy that he had been so well received again in the land of his fathers.
CJ|0|269|2|0|The following day, after he had given over the care of the household to his four sons for the day, he said to Mary,
CJ|0|269|3|0|'Mary, my faithful wife! See, we have a number of relatives and other good friends and acquaintances here in the town.
CJ|0|269|4|0|Go and take the little Child, and James, and if you wish, Eudokia with the five girls,
CJ|0|269|5|0|and let us devote this day to visiting all of our relatives, friends and acquaintances here in Nazareth and the surrounding country,
CJ|0|269|6|0|so they, who no doubt have long felt sorry for me, may also be happy to have us back once more!
CJ|0|269|7|0|And perhaps I will find an opportunity to follow my trade again, so I can earn the daily bread for all of you.'
CJ|0|269|8|0|Mary quite joyfully agreed to this suggestion and put everything in order for this purpose.
CJ|0|269|9|0|Only the little Child at first did not want to go along. But when He was coaxed by His mother, He allowed Himself to be dressed and induced to go along.
CJ|0|269|10|0|But He said, 'I will indeed go with you, but no one shall carry Me!
CJ|0|269|11|0|For when I walk, I want to walk among you wherever you decide to go.
CJ|0|269|12|0|Now do not ask Me why I want it that way, for I do not say everything right out as to why I want to do something one way or the other!'
CJ|0|269|13|0|Here Mary said to the little Child, 'Oh, You will gladly allow Yourself to be carried soon enough when You become really tired!'
CJ|0|269|14|0|And the little Child retorted: 'Oh, you need not worry about that. I never get tired if I do not want to.
CJ|0|269|15|0|But if I want to, I also get tired, but then My weariness is a judgment for men;
CJ|0|269|16|0|for only the sin of men can bring Me to the point where I must want to become tired because of their sin!
CJ|0|269|17|0|'Now I want to impress upon you above everything else that none of you make Me known under any circumstance!
CJ|0|269|18|0|For it is enough that you know that I am the Lord.
CJ|0|269|19|0|You know it without judgment, for your hearts are from the heavens.
CJ|0|269|20|0|But if the children of the earth found it out before the proper time, they would be judged and would have to die!
CJ|0|269|21|0|That is why I did not want to go along at first.
CJ|0|269|22|0|I had to tell you this beforehand; and now that you know it, I will of course go with you.
CJ|0|269|23|0|But understand, I will only walk and not be carried, so the earth will find out through My steps who now walks her ground!'
CJ|0|269|24|0|All remembered these words well and promptly made their way to their relatives, friends and acquaintances.
CJ|0|270|1|1|The Town Of Nazareth Receives A Warning
CJ|0|270|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH started on his way with the members of his family and the little Child walked along between Joseph and Mary, the whole group felt a noticeable quaking of the earth at every step of the little Child.
CJ|0|270|2|0|Joseph found this phenomenon to be quite marked at times and asked Mary,
CJ|0|270|3|0|'Wife, do you not feel how the surface of the earth shakes and quakes?'
CJ|0|270|4|0|Mary replied, 'Oh, I feel that very strongly!
CJ|0|270|5|0|If only a mighty storm, which likes to appear after an earthquake, does not strike us while on the way or in the town!
CJ|0|270|6|0|And notice, the earthquake continues on, which I have not experienced before.
CJ|0|270|7|0|Oh, a terrible storm will surely follow!'
CJ|0|270|8|0|Here Joseph said, 'I still do not see the least cloud anywhere in the sky;
CJ|0|270|9|0|but for all that you could be quite right.
CJ|0|270|10|0|If this earthquake does not come to an end very soon, it will not even be safe to go into the town.'
CJ|0|270|11|0|As the family neared the town, a number of refugees already came toward them from there and warned them about going there.
CJ|0|270|12|0|And they declared, 'Friends, from wherever you may be, be sure not to go into the town!
CJ|0|270|13|0|For a mighty earthquake was there less than half an hour ago, and one is not safe for a minute from the collapse of the houses!'
CJ|0|270|14|0|Even Joseph was somewhat in doubt here whether or not he should turn back.
CJ|0|270|15|0|Here James went over to Joseph and said to him in an aside,
CJ|0|270|16|0|'Father, you must not be afraid - this earthquake will not do the least harm to anyone, neither in the town nor in the surrounding country.'
CJ|0|270|17|0|At this Joseph quickly understood whence the earthquake came.
CJ|0|270|18|0|He therefore promptly encouraged all the members of his family to go into the town.
CJ|0|270|19|0|But when the refugees saw that the old man went into the town,
CJ|0|270|20|0|they said among themselves, 'Just who must this man be, that he has no fear of the earthquake?'
CJ|0|270|21|0|And they guessed back and forth; but no one recognized him.
CJ|0|270|22|0|Then they wanted to go back into the town also;
CJ|0|270|23|0|but when the earth began to quake again as the little Child walked onward, they fled. - And Joseph quite fearlessly went into the town with his family.
CJ|0|271|1|1|Joseph Exhorts The Nazarenes To True Penance
CJ|0|271|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH CAME into the town, he saw the people running about in great fear and confusion,
CJ|0|271|2|0|and all cried, 'The Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob has visited us with great judgment!
CJ|0|271|3|0|Rend your garments, strew ashes upon your heads, and repent, so the Lord may have mercy on us again!'
CJ|0|271|4|0|Thus a few also pressed over to Joseph and hastily asked him whether he would not rend his garments also.
CJ|0|271|5|0|But Joseph said, 'Oh brothers, if you really want to do penance, then do it rather in your hearts than in your garments!
CJ|0|271|6|0|For the Lord looks neither at the color of the garment, nor whether it is whole or torn;
CJ|0|271|7|0|but the Lord looks only upon the heart to see how matters stand with it!
CJ|0|271|8|0|'For the heart can contain evil such as bad thoughts, greed, a base will;
CJ|0|271|9|0|incontinence, prostitution, adultery and other base things.
CJ|0|271|10|0|Put such out of your hearts if it is in them, and you will do better than if you rend your garments and strew ashes upon your head!'
CJ|0|271|11|0|When the faint-hearted Nazarenes heard these words from Joseph they stepped back, and many of them said among themselves,
CJ|0|271|12|0|'Just who is that man who uses such speech here as if he were a great prophet?'
CJ|0|271|13|0|Here the little Child nudged Joseph and said smilingly,
CJ|0|271|14|0|'Now you have spoken aright - that is what these blind ones needed!
CJ|0|271|15|0|But now the ground shall rest again, so we can go on without any trouble.'
CJ|0|271|16|0|Thereupon the family went to a friend of Joseph, who was a physician in Nazareth.
CJ|0|271|17|0|When the latter beheld the aged Joseph, he hastened toward him with all of his family, fell about his neck and exclaimed,
CJ|0|271|18|0|'Oh Joseph, Joseph, my very dear friend and brother! How is it that you now come along in this troubled hour?
CJ|0|271|19|0|Just where were you throughout three long years?
CJ|0|271|20|0|From whence do you come now? What angel of God has led you this way?'
CJ|0|271|21|0|But Joseph answered, 'Brother, first lead us into the house and give us water to cleanse our feet,
CJ|0|271|22|0|whereupon you shall find out everything as to where I was and from whence I now come.' - And the physician at once fulfilled Joseph's wish.
CJ|0|272|1|1|Joseph Visits His Friend The Doctor
CJ|0|272|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH AND HIS FAMILY had cleansed their feet and entered the doctor's living room where several patients were being treated, the newcomers sat down and Joseph briefly told the doctor the main events of his flight and their cause.
CJ|0|272|2|0|When the doctor heard this, he was greatly stirred up against Herod and all the more so toward his still living son Archelaus,
CJ|0|272|3|0|and pictured this frenzied tyrant as being far worse than his father.
CJ|0|272|4|0|And Joseph responded, 'Friend, what you now have told me about Archelaus, I have already heard on my journey here.
CJ|0|272|5|0|But the Lord has already provided for me!
CJ|0|272|6|0|You see, I now live in a free house and am just like a Roman citizen and therefore have nothing to do with the ruthless tyrant.'
CJ|0|272|7|0|Here the doctor said, 'Oh friend, just look at my house here which also had the imperial charter;
CJ|0|272|8|0|but only recently the tribute beadles of Archelaus came at night, ripped the little plaque from the door and attached an outrageous lien against me the following day.
CJ|0|272|9|0|The same thing can happen to you also - therefore be greatly on your guard!
CJ|0|272|10|0|For I tell you: Nothing is holy to this devil of a king - what he does not rob, that is then seized by his spurious lessees and his most despicable scavengers of toll collectors!'
CJ|0|272|11|0|When Joseph heard this from the doctor, he was full of resentment himself over Archelaus and asserted,
CJ|0|272|12|0|'Just let this ruthless tyrant try that, and I guarantee that he shall fare badly for it!
CJ|0|272|13|0|For I have the word of the prefect that Archelaus will be treated like a traitor to the state as soon as he does not respect the privilege accorded by Rome.'
CJ|0|272|14|0|But the doctor said, 'Oh brother, just depend more on anything else than upon such privileges,
CJ|0|272|15|0|for no fox can extricate himself from the noose after a crime more cleverly than this Greek beast.
CJ|0|272|16|0|See, what did he do in my case when I complained to the Roman court?
CJ|0|272|17|0|He immediately accused his agent of acting on his own account and had him thrown into prison.
CJ|0|272|18|0|But when I thereupon applied to his court for compensation, I was rejected with the following reply:
CJ|0|272|19|0|Since the evidence has shown that the king had no part in this outrage, he is neither liable, but only the perpetrator who acted on his own behalf.
CJ|0|272|20|0|And since nothing was found in his possession, the loss must be borne by the owner as in the case of a common theft. - See, with that I was dismissed!
CJ|0|272|21|0|The little plaque was in fact fastened to the door of my house again; but for how long, that Archelaus will will know best.'
CJ|0|272|22|0|When Joseph heard this he was angry and did not know what to say. Here the little Child said,
CJ|0|272|23|0|'Oh do not be angry because of him who is really impotent; and remember that there is still another Lord who can do more than Rome!' - Thereupon Joseph became calm, and the doctor made big eyes, for he knew nothing about the Child.
CJ|0|273|1|1|The Messiah Will Found A Spiritual Kingdom
CJ|0|273|1|0|AFTER A WHILE the doctor inquired of Joseph,
CJ|0|273|2|0|'But friend and brother! What in the Lord's name sort of a Child do you have there, who already talks as wisely as a high priest in the temple of the Lord, when he stands before the most holy sanctuary bedecked with the Urim and Thummim?
CJ|0|273|3|0|Truly, He spoke only a few words and they penetrated to my very marrow!
CJ|0|273|4|0|You did of course tell me in your story how the Child was the reason for your flight into Egypt, and sketchily told me a number of strange things about His birth,
CJ|0|273|5|0|from which I surmised that in time, if this Child would go through the Essenes' school of the prophets, He might come out a great prophet.
CJ|0|273|6|0|But as I now have heard Him speak, He just does not need the school of the Essenes;
CJ|0|273|7|0|for thus He already is a prophet of the first degree like a Samuel and like an Elias and Isaiah!'
CJ|0|273|8|0|At this Joseph was a bit embarrassed and did not know what sort of an answer he should give his friend so soon.
CJ|0|273|9|0|Here the little Child came to Joseph again and said to him,
CJ|0|273|10|0|'Just leave the doctor in his faith; for he too is called to the kingdom of God, but he shall not find out too much at one time!'
CJ|0|273|11|0|When the doctor heard these words also, he said in great surprise,
CJ|0|273|12|0|'Yes, yes brother Joseph! I have spoken correctly to you!
CJ|0|273|13|0|That Child is already a prophet who will declare to us the promised Messiah, whose coming is near;
CJ|0|273|14|0|for He just spoke plainly of the kingdom of God, to which I am also to be called.
CJ|0|273|15|0|Now do I indeed realize why this little Samuel has just consoled you with a Lord who is mightier than Rome.
CJ|0|273|16|0|Yes, when the Messiah comes, then the same thing will happen to Rome as once happened to Jericho in the days of Joshua!'
CJ|0|273|17|0|Here the little Child asserted, 'Oho, friend, what are you saying? Do you not know that it is written: No prophet shall come out of Galilee!
CJ|0|273|18|0|And if so, who then may He be who comes forth from the tribe of David?
CJ|0|273|19|0|I tell you this: When the Messiah will come, He will pull no sword against Rome,
CJ|0|273|20|0|but will only have His spiritual kingdom proclaimed through His messengers on earth!'
CJ|0|273|21|0|Here the doctor was taken aback and declared after a while, 'Truly, in You God has visited His people!'
CJ|0|273|22|0|And Joseph agreed with the doctor, but made no further explanation.
CJ|0|274|1|1|The Child Heals A Girl Of Palsy
CJ|0|274|1|0|AFTER THIS DISCUSSION the little Child walked gaily about the room and asked the patients, who were afflicted with all manner of ills, what was the matter with them and how they had contracted such maladies.
CJ|0|274|2|0|But the patients replied, 'You lively little Boy, we have already told the doctor about that and he will heal us accordingly.
CJ|0|274|3|0|It just would not be seemly here in front of the guests that we should confess our sins, which are surely the cause of the infirmities of our bodies;
CJ|0|274|4|0|so You just go to the doctor who will perhaps tell You if it is proper for You to know!'
CJ|0|274|5|0|Here the little Child smiled and asked the patients,
CJ|0|274|6|0|'Would you not tell Me the cause of your infirmities either if I positively could help you?'
CJ|0|274|7|0|And the patients said, 'Oh yes, then indeed;
CJ|0|274|8|0|but for that You still have a great deal to learn. It will be quite some time until You become a doctor.'
CJ|0|274|9|0|And the little Child asserted, 'Oh not at all, for I already am a completely versed Physician and have brought matters to the point where I can also heal instantly.
CJ|0|274|10|0|And I tell you: Whoever among you will put his trust in Me first, he shall also be the first to instantly get well!'
CJ|0|274|11|0|There was a twelve-year-old girl afflicted with palsy, who took pleasure in the Child and said to Him,
CJ|0|274|12|0|'So come here then, You little Physician, I want to let You heal me!'
CJ|0|274|13|0|Here the little Child went over to the girl and said to her,
CJ|0|274|14|0|'Because you were the first to call upon Me, you shall also be the first to get well!
CJ|0|274|15|0|See, I know the cause of your sickness, which rests with those who begat you;
CJ|0|274|16|0|but you are without sin, therefore I say to you:
CJ|0|274|17|0|Arise and walk freely, and remember Me!
CJ|0|274|18|0|But tell no one now that I have healed you!'
CJ|0|274|19|0|And behold, the twelve-year-old girl was well instantly, arose and walked freely.
CJ|0|274|20|0|When the other patients saw this, they also requested that they be healed.
CJ|0|274|21|0|But the little Child did not go to their beds because they had not requested it earlier.
CJ|0|275|1|1|The Doctor Comes Into A Great Reputation
CJ|0|275|1|0|WHEN THE DOCTOR saw this miraculous healing of the girl whom he had declared to be wholly incurable,
CJ|0|275|2|0|he was almost breathless in his great wonderment and said to Joseph,
CJ|0|275|3|0|'Oh brother, I beg you, go away from here,
CJ|0|275|4|0|for I am becoming greatly afraid in my heart!
CJ|0|275|5|0|See, I am a sinful man, and the Spirit of the Lord is obviously present in your Child!
CJ|0|275|6|0|For how can a poor sinner endure before the allseeing and almighty Spirit of the Most High?'
CJ|0|275|7|0|Here the little Child went over to the doctor and said to him,
CJ|0|275|8|0|'Man! Why are you so foolish now and are afraid of Me?
CJ|0|275|9|0|Just what harm did I do to you that you now fear Me so?
CJ|0|275|10|0|Do you really suppose the healing of the girl was a wonder?
CJ|0|275|11|0|I say to you: not at all, for you need only undertake to treat the other patients in this manner, and they will be healed!
CJ|0|275|12|0|Go over, awaken their faith, then lay your hands on them, and they will get well in an instant!
CJ|0|275|13|0|But first you must firmly believe yourself that you can help them in this manner and also will help them without fail!'
CJ|0|275|14|0|When the doctor heard this from the little Child he took hold of a firm faith, went over to the patients and did to them according to the advice of the little Child.
CJ|0|275|15|0|And lo, all the patients became well immediately, paid the doctor what they owed him, and honored and praised God that He gave such power to man!
CJ|0|275|16|0|In this wise the miraculous nature of the Child conveniently fell away before the eyes of the world.
CJ|0|275|17|0|And the doctor came into a very great reputation,
CJ|0|275|18|0|and many sick people came to him from far and near and found their healing.
CJ|0|275|19|0|When the twelve-year-old girl saw that the doctor thus healed miraculously, she supposed that the Child had done this through the doctor, and thereupon praised the doctor's wisdom also.
CJ|0|275|20|0|Against this the little Child made no complaint, for He had lent such power to the doctor that He would not be suspected.
CJ|0|275|21|0|Only Joseph said to the girl, 'Girl, consider that all power comes from above!
CJ|0|275|22|0|And since you are not in anyone's service now, come into my house and you shall be provided for!' - Thereupon the girl promptly attached herself to Joseph and went with him.
CJ|0|276|1|1|Joseph Visits The Schoolteacher Dumas
CJ|0|276|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH TOOK his leave after several private words with the doctor concerning possible work in his trade as a carpenter, the doctor accompanied him to a nearby friend named Dumas who was a school teacher in Nazareth.
CJ|0|276|2|0|Then the doctor went home, and Joseph went inside to Dumas.
CJ|0|276|3|0|The latter did not recognize him at first; for he had not though about his old friend for a long time.
CJ|0|276|4|0|Here Joseph asked him whether he really did not know him any more.
CJ|0|276|5|0|At this Dumas rubbed his forehead and said,
CJ|0|276|6|0|'You do have a striking resemblance with a certain Joseph who had difficulties here three years ago because of a certain temple wench;
CJ|0|276|7|0|for this otherwise most upright man also had to go to Bethlehem to be recorded, and that with his whole family.
CJ|0|276|8|0|What happened to him after that, I do not know.
CJ|0|276|9|0|You do greatly resemble this to me highly venerated man; but you surely are not he?'
CJ|0|276|10|0|And Joseph answered, 'And if I still were the same, would you not send me some work in my trade?
CJ|0|276|11|0|You see, I now live on my little farmstead again.'
CJ|0|276|12|0|When Dumas heard this from Joseph, he said,
CJ|0|276|13|0|'Yes, now it is plain, you are he, you are truly my old friend and brother Joseph!
CJ|0|276|14|0|But where in heaven's name do you come from now?'
CJ|0|276|15|0|Joseph replied, 'Brother, first give me a wet cloth, so I may clean my feet from the dust, then you shall hear everything that should be told.'
CJ|0|276|16|0|Dumas immediately had a wet cloth brought, and a jug of water, and all those with Joseph washed their feet and then went into the school house of Dumas.
CJ|0|276|17|0|Here Joseph with a minimum of words told his three-year story.
CJ|0|276|18|0|In the meantime the little Child occupied Himself with a few school children who were there just then and were learning to read and to write a little.
CJ|0|276|19|0|One of the school children promptly read something to the little Child, but made a number of errors.
CJ|0|276|20|0|At this the little Child smiled right along and industriously corrected the errors for the reader.
CJ|0|276|21|0|This soon caught the attention of all the school children and they asked Him when and where He had learned to read so well.
CJ|0|276|22|0|And the little Child replied, 'Oh that is just born in Me!'
CJ|0|276|23|0|Here all the children laughed, then went and told all this to Dumas; and the latter thereupon became observant of the Child and began to ask Joseph concerning such capability of the little Child.
CJ|0|277|1|1|The Child Gives Dumas A Mighty Setback
CJ|0|277|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH SAW how Dumas made a great effort to find out from whence the little Child had such a remarkable attribute, he said to him,
CJ|0|277|2|0|'Brother, I know only too well that you studied the wisdom of the Greeks and have often quoted the precepts of the wise Socrates to me.
CJ|0|277|3|0|And there it states: Man does not have to learn anything, for his spirit needs only to be awakened on the path of recollection,
CJ|0|277|4|0|and man then has everything he needs for all eternity.
CJ|0|277|5|0|See, as a wise teacher of young people you have often told me that.
CJ|0|277|6|0|Now behold, if such precept of yours is surely correct, what more is needed?
CJ|0|277|7|0|And with my Child you accordingly see nothing else than a living confirmation of your Socratic precept.
CJ|0|277|8|0|His Spirit has been awakened in a manner peculiar to His nature, and thus this Child-man even now has enough for eternity,
CJ|0|277|9|0|and therefore we do not need to give Him anything besides what He has of Himself.
CJ|0|277|10|0|Do you not find that to be as right as it is right that one plus one equals two?'
CJ|0|277|11|0|Here Dumas grasped his forehead and said with a certain pathos,
CJ|0|277|12|0|'Yes, so is it; and so it was I who gave the Jewish dumbbells a whiff of such wisdom!
CJ|0|277|13|0|But I do not of course mean to include you among them, for you are really almost the only one with whom, in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, I have been able to talk about the divine Socrates, Aristotle, Plato and others.
CJ|0|277|14|0|To be sure, we also have very great men such as the prophets and the first great kings of this people;
CJ|0|277|15|0|but as far as practical matters are concerned, they are not as useful as the wise old men of the Greeks.
CJ|0|277|16|0|For our prophets constantly expressed themselves in such speech which they themselves understood perhaps as little as we do now.
CJ|0|277|17|0|But compared to that the old Greeks are quite something else;
CJ|0|277|18|0|for these say clearly and plainly what they want, and therefore are also of greatest benefit to practical men.
CJ|0|277|19|0|And that surely stems from the fact that they, like me, were teachers of the people.'
CJ|0|277|20|0|This made Joseph smile, for here he beheld his old venerator of the Greeks as unchanged as ever, besides being the same old self-praiser.
CJ|0|277|21|0|He accordingly agreed with him, so as to not bring his Child under suspicion.
CJ|0|277|22|0|But the little Child now went over to Dumas and declared,
CJ|0|277|23|0|'But friend! You are still very confused and foolish if you place the Jewish wise men after the philosophers of the Greeks;
CJ|0|277|24|0|for the former spoke from God - but these speak from the world.
CJ|0|277|25|0|And since you are still filled with the spirit of the world and empty of the Spirit of God, you therefore understand worldly matters better than divine matters!'
CJ|0|277|26|0|This gave Dumas a mighty setback. He gave a learned yawn and merely remarked to Joseph in Latin, 'Dixit puer ille! Ergo autem intelligo eius ironiam quam acer-bam. Dixi!' - Then he departed and left Joseph sitting there; whereupon the latter also went his way.
CJ|0|278|1|1|Joseph Confounds The Beadles Of Archelaus
CJ|0|278|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH was some distance away from Dumas, he said to his family,
CJ|0|278|2|0|'It seems to me that we can probably expect to find a similar reception everywhere -
CJ|0|278|3|0|so let us not spend much more time visiting our former friends, acquaintances and relatives;
CJ|0|278|4|0|for I have just seen with Dumas how people act if one crosses them even just a little.
CJ|0|278|5|0|It therefore seems to me that we should go home again. - What do you, my faithful wife, say to that?'
CJ|0|278|6|0|And Mary answered, 'Joseph, my beloved husband, you well know that I have no will before you, since your will is also mine at all times and also must be according to the divine order of the Lord;
CJ|0|278|7|0|but I would surely say that since the Lord Himself walks bodily in our midst, we should ask His advice in this matter also.'
CJ|0|278|8|0|Here Joseph agreed, 'Mary, my faithful wife, therein you are altogether right;
CJ|0|278|9|0|that I will do at once, and then we will find out for certain just what we should do!'
CJ|0|278|10|0|And the little Child said without being asked, 'Even though everything were in order wherever we went, it still would be better to be at home.
CJ|0|278|11|0|You see, My time is still a long way off, and if I now go with you wherever it may be, I still cannot cover up the fullness of My Deity to the extent that such may not be felt by those nearby.
CJ|0|278|12|0|Therefore it is best for Me to stay at home now, for there What dwells in Me is least noticed.
CJ|0|278|13|0|When you, Joseph, have to go anywhere in the near future in matters of your trade, then just go out with your other children,
CJ|0|278|14|0|but leave Me nicely at home, and you will have the least trouble.'
CJ|0|278|15|0|Joseph thereupon returned to his home. And when he arrived there, he found to his not little surprise that his four sons, who had remained at home, were in a mighty argument with a few overseers of Archelaus.
CJ|0|278|16|0|These vultures were quick to notice that someone had moved in here;
CJ|0|278|17|0|for which reason they also were promptly at hand to extort the tribute.
CJ|0|278|18|0|But when the sons of Joseph showed them the charter on the door, they became angered thereat and wanted to tear it off.
CJ|0|278|19|0|And just at this moment Joseph arrived and at once confronted the thieves with the question by what authority they did this.
CJ|0|278|20|0|These asserted, 'We are servants of the king and do this according to the authority of the king!'
CJ|0|278|21|0|Here Joseph declared, 'And I am a servant of God the Almighty and am sending you on your way according to His authority!' - At this the marauders were seized with a mighty fear, and they ran away in great haste. And thereafter Joseph's house was left in peace from similar marauders.
CJ|0|279|1|1|Jonathan As Fisherman In The Sea Of Galilee
CJ|0|279|1|0|THUS TWO YEARS PASSED, and nothing unusual took place any more in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|279|2|0|Cyrenius did indeed receive the news of the emigration of Joseph, but still could not visit him there, since at this very time he was overburdened with matters of state from Rome.
CJ|0|279|3|0|And Cornelius also did not fare much better;
CJ|0|279|4|0|for just as often as he wanted to absent himself to visit Salome and his friend Joseph, he also had to deal with very important matters of office.
CJ|0|279|5|0|All this the Lord had already foreordained so the little Child in Nazareth could grow in that much more obscurity.
CJ|0|279|6|0|Thus the people in Nazareth were in complete ignorance of the nature of the Child.
CJ|0|279|7|0|Only the already known doctor drew attention far and near as a result of his miraculous cures.
CJ|0|279|8|0|And it became a regular byword that the sick were told,
CJ|0|279|9|0|'If Nazareth cannot heal you, then the whole world cannot heal you either!'
CJ|0|279|10|0|And Salome made a constant effort to serve Joseph's house as the opportunity arose, and the little Child spent much time in the house of Salome.
CJ|0|279|11|0|When two years had gone by, Jonathan finally followed Joseph from Egypt and came to visit him.
CJ|0|279|12|0|Joseph was overjoyed at seeing his friend again, and the little Child also danced with joy around His big fisherman.
CJ|0|279|13|0|When Jonathan had spent about three weeks in Joseph's house all by himself, since all his people in Egypt died in an epidemic of yellow fever,
CJ|0|279|14|0|he asked Joseph if he could not assist him in finding work in his trade as a fisherman.
CJ|0|279|15|0|Here the little Child stood up and said to Jonathan,
CJ|0|279|16|0|'Do you know, dear Jonathan, the people here are mostly wicked and very selfish,
CJ|0|279|17|0|so there will not be much to do for you here. Now you go to the Sea of Galilee, which is not far from here, where the fishing trade is still open to all.
CJ|0|279|18|0|There you will soon find a good little spot and will always be able to catch the best fish with little effort.
CJ|0|279|19|0|Then come often to the market place in Nazareth with these fish, and you will have a good trade!'
CJ|0|279|20|0|Jonathan promptly followed this advice, and lo, he soon found a widow there who had a little house by the Sea of Galilee.
CJ|0|279|21|0|This widow took a great liking to Jonathan, took him into her house and soon thereafter gave him her hand.
CJ|0|279|22|0|Thus Jonathan became an excellent fisherman again in the Sea of Galilee and had the best trade everywhere because of the very reasonable prices of his fish,
CJ|0|279|23|0|while at the same time he made it a matter of first importance to regale Joseph and Salome every week with a generous quantity of the most select fish.
CJ|0|279|24|0|And this occurrence was the only memorable one since two years, and nothing else occurred that would have been worth recording.
CJ|0|280|1|1|The Miracle Of The Twelve Sparrows
CJ|0|280|1|0|ONE SABBATH, when the Child was five years and a few weeks old, He went to a little brook that flowed not far from Joseph's farmstead.
CJ|0|280|2|0|The day was truly serene, and several children accompanied the lively little Jesus there;
CJ|0|280|3|0|for all the children of the neighbors loved Jesus very much because He was always happy and knew how to arrange many innocent children's games.
CJ|0|280|4|0|For this reason they followed Him quite joyfully this time also.
CJ|0|280|5|0|When the little company arrived at the brook, the little Jesus asked His playmates whether it really would be permissible to play on a Sabbath.
CJ|0|280|6|0|Here the children replied, 'Children under six years are free from the law, and each of us is hardly six years old,
CJ|0|280|7|0|so we may surely play on the Sabbath! Besides, our parents have never denied us this.'
CJ|0|280|8|0|And the Child Jesus said thereto, 'Well spoken. Then let us play a game!
CJ|0|280|9|0|But so we will not offend anyone, I will show you something very remarkable just among ourselves.
CJ|0|280|10|0|Now you must be perfectly silent thereby.'
CJ|0|280|11|0|At this the other children sat down on the ground which was thickly covered with grass, were altogether silent and did not stir.
CJ|0|280|12|0|The little Jesus then took a small knife from His pocket and cut out twelve little round holes by the smoothly trod path beside the brook and filled them with water from the brook.
CJ|0|280|13|0|Thereupon He took some soft clay from the edge of the brook and quickly formed twelve little birds in the form of sparrows and placed a sparrow beside each little hole filled with water.
CJ|0|280|14|0|When the clay sparrows were thus put in place, the little Jesus asked His playmates the meaning of this.
CJ|0|280|15|0|And these replied, 'What else, besides what it is? - Twelve little holes filled with water and twelve clay sparrows beside them!'
CJ|0|280|16|0|Here the little Jesus said, 'That surely, but this likeness also has quite another meaning.
CJ|0|280|17|0|Listen, and I will explain it to you! The twelve small holes signify the twelve tribes of Israel.
CJ|0|280|18|0|The clear water in them is the Word of God, which is the same everywhere;
CJ|0|280|19|0|and the dead clay sparrows represent mankind as it now generally is.
CJ|0|280|20|0|The children of men also stand by the living water of the Word of God, but because they are too earthly, like these sparrows, they also stand dead by the pools of life which are filled with life;
CJ|0|280|21|0|but they neither can nor wish to give heed to this, for they are dead because of their sins.
CJ|0|280|22|0|Therefore the Lord God Zebaoth now comes in the time of greatest affliction and will restore these dead children of men to life, and they will be able to fly up to the clouds of heaven again.'
CJ|0|280|23|0|Now this children's game was noticed by a passerby, a strict Jew who knew Joseph. The Jew thereupon hurried into the house and made a great commotion before Joseph, asking why he desecrated the Sabbath by thus allowing his children to play.
CJ|0|280|24|0|Here Joseph at once went with him to the children and there made a false bluster for the sake of the stranger.
CJ|0|280|25|0|At this the little Jesus said, 'That is also a great affliction. And so I give life to you clay sparrows - and now fly away!'
CJ|0|280|26|0|And suddenly the clay sparrows took wing and flew away. Thereat all were seized with a feverish amazement, and the strict Jew said no more. - And that was the first miracle of the little Jesus when He was five years old.
CJ|0|281|1|1|An Ill-Tempered Boy's Lesson
CJ|0|281|1|0|ON THIS OCCASION a few other Jews also came to the spot where this wonder took place,
CJ|0|281|2|0|and they very curiously asked Joseph what had taken place here.
CJ|0|281|3|0|Among these were the neighboring parents of a certain very quarrelsome boy, who as the only child of his parents was greatly spoiled.
CJ|0|281|4|0|The little Boy Jesus had already reprimanded this seven-year-old boy often because of his quarrelsome nature -
CJ|0|281|5|0|but this did not help matters much; for as often as a new opportunity arose, he promptly quarreled again and quickly destroyed some plaything.
CJ|0|281|6|0|This boy, who was present with the children this time also, became excited shortly after this wonder, took a willow twig and exclaimed,
CJ|0|281|7|0|'Not bad, that these clay sparrows have flown away;
CJ|0|281|8|0|so I shall promptly make the water fly away also with this twig!'
CJ|0|281|9|0|After these words the boy, whose name was Annas, began to whip the water and to drive it from the little holes.
CJ|0|281|10|0|Here the patience of the God-Child broke, and He said in a very serious tone of voice:
CJ|0|281|11|0|'Oh you resentful, foolish, evil human being! You, a devil only recently come into the flesh, want to destroy what I have built?
CJ|0|281|12|0|Oh you wretch, whom I can destroy with the least breath, you want to annoy Me and always defy Me?
CJ|0|281|13|0|Behold, so your folly and your spite may become evident, you shall shrivel up for three years like the twig with which you have driven My water!'
CJ|0|281|14|0|Upon this word of the God-Child the malicious boy at once sank down and shriveled up so greatly that nothing was to be seen but skin and bones
CJ|0|281|15|0|and he became so weak that he could not stand and all the less walk.
CJ|0|281|16|0|Here the sad parents took their shriveled child and carried him home weeping.
CJ|0|281|17|0|Soon thereafter they came into Joseph's house and then brought an action against Joseph with the chief judge because of what his Child had done,
CJ|0|281|18|0|which they did because Joseph did not permit them to punish his God-Child for this deed.
CJ|0|281|19|0|When the chief judge arrived, the little Jesus went to meet him and asked him,
CJ|0|281|20|0|'Why do you come here? Do you want to judge Me?'
CJ|0|281|21|0|And the chief judge replied, 'Not You, but Your father!'
CJ|0|281|22|0|And the little Jesus warned, 'Go back quickly, or your judgment will come upon you!'
CJ|0|281|23|0|At this the chief judge became so frightened that he suddenly turned back and then would not hear any more about this matter.
CJ|0|281|24|0|And that was the second wonder which the little Jesus effected at that same time.
CJ|0|282|1|1|The Wages Of The Shepherd Boy
CJ|0|282|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH'S HOUSE was thus left in peace, since the chief judge would not accept any more complaints against Joseph,
CJ|0|282|2|0|it so happened eight days later that Joseph had to go into a neighboring village to a building site.
CJ|0|282|3|0|On this occasion the little Jesus wanted to go with Joseph, and Joseph was more than glad to take Him along.
CJ|0|282|4|0|But the parents of the shriveled boy were filled with strong anger against Joseph and his Child.
CJ|0|282|5|0|Now to go into the village, Joseph had to go past the house of this boy's parents.
CJ|0|282|6|0|When Joseph came near the house with the little Jesus, he was noticed,
CJ|0|282|7|0|and the angry neighbor said to one of his also very headstrong servant boys, who usually herded his sheep,
CJ|0|282|8|0|'See, there comes the carpenter up the path just now with his pestilential Brood.
CJ|0|282|9|0|Go, and run down this path with all your might.
CJ|0|282|10|0|And when you get to the Boy at the side of the carpenter, thrust Him down with all your strength, so He will be left dead!
CJ|0|282|11|0|After that the old scoundrel can prosecute me - and I shall then show him the law that children under twelve years of age cannot be held accountable in worldly matters!'
CJ|0|282|12|0|When the shepherd boy heard this from his master who had also promised him a good reward if he killed the Child,
CJ|0|282|13|0|the boy suddenly ran out of the room and toward Joseph in great haste.
CJ|0|282|14|0|At this moment the shriveled son Annas, who was in bed, said to his father,
CJ|0|282|15|0|'Oh look, how quickly does the shepherd boy run toward his death, and what sorrow that will be for his parents!
CJ|0|282|16|0|Oh father, you should not have done that! For I tell you, as I see it now: Joseph is just, and holy his Child!'
CJ|0|282|17|0|Thereupon the gaunt boy was silent, and his father thought about the words of his son.
CJ|0|282|18|0|But at that moment the shepherd boy in furious haste came upon the little Jesus and butted Him on the shoulder with considerable force.
CJ|0|282|19|0|Despite this the little Jesus did not fall, and He said to the shepherd boy in a greatly excited tone of voice,
CJ|0|282|20|0|'That you did for the sake of a reward! Thus every laborer is worthy of his hire, and - as the labor, so also the reward.
CJ|0|282|21|0|Your labor was to kill Me; therefore let death be your reward also!'
CJ|0|282|22|0|Here the shepherd boy suddenly sank down and was dead.
CJ|0|282|23|0|Joseph was greatly frightened at this; but the little Jesus said, 'Joseph, have no fear on My account; for what here happened to a boy, that will happen to the whole world if it wants to strike us!' - Thereupon Joseph went his way and left the dead boy laying there according to the will of the Child.
CJ|0|283|1|1|A Father's Entreaty
CJ|0|283|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH CAME into the village and looked at the work to be done,
CJ|0|283|2|0|there the hue and cry already came after him, especially on the part of the shriveled boy's father.
CJ|0|283|3|0|The latter had at once sought out the parents of the dead shepherd boy and incited them against Joseph.
CJ|0|283|4|0|And these ran hastily and desperately over to Joseph and shouted,
CJ|0|283|5|0|'Begone from here with your terrible Child, with which every word is an accomplished deed!
CJ|0|283|6|0|For children are always supposed to be a blessing to mankind from above;
CJ|0|283|7|0|but your Child is only come to curse us!
CJ|0|283|8|0|Therefore be gone from here, you bringer of woe!'
CJ|0|283|9|0|Here the little Jesus retorted: 'If so, what then are you to Me?
CJ|0|283|10|0|Did you, father of Annas, not tell the shepherd boy that he should kill Me?
CJ|0|283|11|0|Did you not even promise him a good reward if he should kill Me, since he acted safely because he was not yet subject to the law?
CJ|0|283|12|0|And behold, thus I also thought in My early enlightenment of Spirit:
CJ|0|283|13|0|I too am still far from being subject to the law; therefore I shall also give the boy his well-deserved reward immediately.
CJ|0|283|14|0|And if you take Me or father Joseph before the court, we too will know how to explain the law to you.
CJ|0|283|15|0|See, thus I have thought like you and also acted upon it. How then can you find your own conduct unjust in us?'
CJ|0|283|16|0|At these words of the little Jesus the father of the shriveled boy was seized with a great fear;
CJ|0|283|17|0|for he saw therefrom very clearly that this little Boy also knew the thoughts and the secret resolves of men,
CJ|0|283|18|0|and that one would have to be very careful of Him.
CJ|0|283|19|0|Thereupon all the shouters left Joseph and the little Jesus.
CJ|0|283|20|0|Only the father of the slain child remained before Joseph and wept for his boy and said, 'Killing is no art, but restoring to life is!
CJ|0|283|21|0|Therefore no one should ever kill who cannot restore to life!'
CJ|0|283|22|0|And the little Jesus replied, 'That I could do also, if I wanted to; but your boy was bad, therefore I do not want to!' - Upon these words the father began to entreat the little Boy. And the little Jesus said, 'Tomorrow, but not today!'
CJ|0|284|1|1|A Glorious Promise To All Of Good Will
CJ|0|284|1|0|BUT THE FATHER of the dead boy would not depart from the Child now, since he had heard that the little Jesus could bring his son back to life again.
CJ|0|284|2|0|Here Joseph said to him, 'Friend, I tell you, do not be insistent; for the Boy has His order according to which He acts,
CJ|0|284|3|0|and you will not extort anything from Him even though you clamored still more!
CJ|0|284|4|0|Go instead and bring your boy into your home and lay him, like a sick person, into a good bed, and tomorrow he shall be better off!'
CJ|0|284|5|0|Upon these words the father of the dead boy finally left Joseph and went and did according to Joseph's advice.
CJ|0|284|6|0|Only then did Joseph have peace and gain time to close the agreement for the work with the builder.
CJ|0|284|7|0|Thereupon Joseph went home again and told Mary, Eudokia and Salome, who came to meet him, what all he experienced on this short trip.
CJ|0|284|8|0|All three were surprised at such wickedness of men.
CJ|0|284|9|0|But the little Jesus said, 'Oh, do not be surprised because of the wickedness of men; for if you were to do that, there would be a very great deal to be surprised at in the world.'
CJ|0|284|10|0|Here Salome said to Mary, 'Listen, my most worthy sister: It is just beyond comprehension!
CJ|0|284|11|0|The little God-Child needs only to open His divine mouth, and wisdom just pours out.
CJ|0|284|12|0|Of what enormous, far-seeing wisdom these words again were.
CJ|0|284|13|0|Oh you more than fortunate mother of such a Child!'
CJ|0|284|14|0|And the little Jesus said, 'And oh you more than fortunate Salome, you who bought a house for your Lord
CJ|0|284|15|0|and now witness how He dwells therein bodily.
CJ|0|284|16|0|'What difference is there really between her who for a short time concealed Me in her body,
CJ|0|284|17|0|and between My rightful housekeeper who shelters Me in her house forever?
CJ|0|284|18|0|Now if a mother carries a child in her body, what does she really do toward seeing that it comes to life, grows and then enters into the world?
CJ|0|284|19|0|Is not all of that a work of God, where the will of man can accomplish nothing?
CJ|0|284|20|0|'And if someone takes a child into his house and gives it a home, care and board forever, say, is that not more?
CJ|0|284|21|0|'Truly, I tell you: Those, who like you will in time to come take Me into their hearts spiritually, they will also be equal to My mother, My brothers and My sisters!'
CJ|0|284|22|0|All deeply engraved these words in their hearts and then quietly and thoughtfully went home.
CJ|0|285|1|1|The Reawakening Of The Shepherd Boy
CJ|0|285|1|0|THE FOLLOWING DAY at exactly the same time that the boy ran into the little Jesus, he came to life again in bed, arose, and like someone awakened from a dream asked what was the matter, and how he came to be in this bed.
CJ|0|285|2|0|And his father told him all that had happened and how he came to be there.
CJ|0|285|3|0|At this the boy was filled with fear, and he said, 'Oh father, that is a terrible Child -
CJ|0|285|4|0|who should be avoided by everyone who values his life!
CJ|0|285|5|0|Oh give me into service far away from here, so I will be sure to never meet up somewhere with that terrible Child on some unfavorable occasion;
CJ|0|285|6|0|for there He could instantly kill me again!
CJ|0|285|7|0|But I am not returning to my former master, for he led me to do evil.'
CJ|0|285|8|0|Here the father replied, 'My son, I thank God that I have you back with me!
CJ|0|285|9|0|Therefore I shall never send you into any service again,
CJ|0|285|10|0|and instead shall keep you with me as long as I live!
CJ|0|285|11|0|But we need not fear Joseph's Child as much as you think,
CJ|0|285|12|0|for this Child is the very One who obviously has restored your life at the foretold time.
CJ|0|285|13|0|And if that is so, how then should Joseph's Child be as terrible as you imagine Him to be?
CJ|0|285|14|0|See, my son, whoever kills and cannot restore to life, he is terrible;
CJ|0|285|15|0|but whoever can kill without blood and then bring back to life again, He is not as terrible as you think Him to be.
CJ|0|285|16|0|'And now we shall do something better: We shall go there and thank the carpenter for your awakening.
CJ|0|285|17|0|For I have know for quite a long time that the carpenter is a most righteous and God-fearing man.'
CJ|0|285|18|0|At these words the boy forgot his fear and went with his father to see Joseph.
CJ|0|285|19|0|The latter already met them in the village with his four older sons and with the little Jesus, who was also going to the village with Joseph again.
CJ|0|285|20|0|When the boy beheld the little Jesus he became very weak;
CJ|0|285|21|0|for he supposed he now would have to die again.
CJ|0|285|22|0|But the little Jesus quickly went over to the faint-hearted boy and said to him,
CJ|0|285|23|0|'Joras, do not be afraid of Me; for I love you more than the whole world!
CJ|0|285|24|0|For if I did not love you so mightily, you would not have received your life again.
CJ|0|285|25|0|You see, My love is your life forever!'
CJ|0|285|26|0|When the boy heard the little Jesus speak thus, he quickly changed his mind and stayed all day long and played with Him.
CJ|0|285|27|0|And the little Jesus showed the boy a number of very clever games, which made the boy happy beyond measure.
CJ|0|286|1|1|The Wages Of A False Witness
CJ|0|286|1|0|WHEN JOSEPH RETURNED to work in the village on the following day with his four sons and with the little Jesus,
CJ|0|286|2|0|there came a village judge and accused him, saying,
CJ|0|286|3|0|'Listen, you carpenter! It is not seemly that you always take your little Boy along with you;
CJ|0|286|4|0|for to begin with He has a poisonous exhalation, and in the second place the children whom He touches soon become sick,
CJ|0|286|5|0|or they soon die or become deaf and blind!'
CJ|0|286|6|0|When Joseph heard such lies, he laid the axe aside and demanded of the judge,
CJ|0|286|7|0|'Bring the witnesses here who suffered such harm through my most innocent Boy Jesus,
CJ|0|286|8|0|and I will go with them into the temple and there settle the matter with them before the high priest of God!'
CJ|0|286|9|0|Now this judge was bribed by the father of the shriveled boy
CJ|0|286|10|0|and therefore sought a means to put Joseph's Boy under as much suspicion as possible.
CJ|0|286|11|0|At these words of Joseph the judge went away and in a short time gathered together a great number of greatly afflicted children from the village and led them over to Joseph.
CJ|0|286|12|0|And when he arrived there he accused him again, saying, 'Just look here now! We can thank your poisonous Child for all this!
CJ|0|286|13|0|See, these children have visited your Child a number of times and have played with Him,
CJ|0|286|14|0|and behold, these are the happy results therefrom! So stay away from our village and at the same time keep your Pest at home.'
CJ|0|286|15|0|When Joseph heard this from the judge he was stirred up, took the little Jesus aside, seemingly appealed to His conscience and said,
CJ|0|286|16|0|'Why then do You perpetrate such things? See, these suffer greatly therefrom and hate and persecute us for it!'
CJ|0|286|17|0|But the little Jesus countered Joseph and answered: 'The words which you now have spoken are not from Me, but from you;
CJ|0|286|18|0|for you have now spoken the words of the judge who is a liar - and not My words which are eternally true!
CJ|0|286|19|0|But I will be silent against you and will not give you a reprimand for your assumed speech;
CJ|0|286|20|0|but because of his accusation let this bribed judge receive his just punishment!'
CJ|0|286|21|0|And the judge immediately became stone blind. At this all who were with the judge were greatly shocked.
CJ|0|286|22|0|Several of them became wholly confused and cried,
CJ|0|286|23|0|'Let us flee from here in all haste! For each word from the mouth of this Boy is an accomplished fact!'
CJ|0|286|24|0|Now when Joseph saw that the judge was blind and was certain to cause him a lot of trouble for that,
CJ|0|286|25|0|he became upset over the little Jesus himself, took Him lightly by the lobe of the ear and pulled Him in order to chastize Him before men.
CJ|0|286|26|0|Here the little Jesus became aroused and said to Joseph quite earnestly,
CJ|0|286|27|0|'Let it be enough to you that they seek and still do not find what they seek!
CJ|0|286|28|0|But you did not act wisely this time. - Do you not know that I am yours?
CJ|0|286|29|0|Why then do you want to grieve Me, when I am yours? Oh do not grieve Me any more henceforth, since I am yours!'
CJ|0|286|30|0|At this Joseph quickly realized his mistake, took the little Jesus and pressed Him to his heart. - And all those standing about soon dispersed in their very great fear of the Boy.
CJ|0|287|1|1|A Schoolteacher Learns The Alphabet
CJ|0|287|1|0|AFTER A TIME of about three months, when Joseph had completed the work in the village, a certain Piras Zachaeus came from Nazareth on a visit to Joseph and for the first time made personal acquaintance with the Boy, about whom he had already heard a number of things.
CJ|0|287|2|0|Therefore he came only because of the little Jesus.
CJ|0|287|3|0|For Piras Zachaeus was a substitute teacher in the town who had little to do but still had a very high opinion of his wisdom.
CJ|0|287|4|0|Now why did he secretly visit Joseph in regard to the little Jesus?
CJ|0|287|5|0|Because he thought, 'That must be a very talented Boy
CJ|0|287|6|0|whom I shall bring into my class, so that by His quick progress my class will get a better reputation than that of my rival!'
CJ|0|287|7|0|He therefore concerned himself mainly with the Boy Jesus, questioned Him about various things and always received the most conclusive answers at which he was greatly surprised.
CJ|0|287|8|0|When he had thus investigated the Boy, he turned to Joseph and said to him,
CJ|0|287|9|0|'Brother, the little One truly has an extraordinary understanding for His age. It is really true that you have a very intelligent little Boy here -
CJ|0|287|10|0|only it is too bad that He still cannot read nor write the letters!
CJ|0|287|11|0|Would you send Him into my school, so He could learn to read and write the letters with me?
CJ|0|287|12|0|I will then also teach Him all the other arts and sciences, so He may learn to greet the elders and honor them like grandfathers and fathers;
CJ|0|287|13|0|and you know, so He may also learn to love His playmates, towards whom on a number of occasions He is supposed to have acted very unmercifully;
CJ|0|287|14|0|and so He finally may also learn the Law of Moses, know the history of God's people and the wisdom of God in the prophets.'
CJ|0|287|15|0|And Joseph answered the teacher, 'Good, my friend and brother! But before you take this Boy into your school, make a little test here before several witnesses who are with me today.
CJ|0|287|16|0|Recite all the letters to Him and explain them to Him clearly; then examine Him,
CJ|0|287|17|0|and from what the Boy will have remembered of the explanation, you will then be able to form the best judgment as to how His talent is constituted.'
CJ|0|287|18|0|This the teacher promptly did. He distinctly recited the letters from Alpha to Omega to the Boy and also explained the symbols to the best of his ability.
CJ|0|287|19|0|But Jesus looked at the teacher in surprise, and as he thereupon examined Him, asked the teacher,
CJ|0|287|20|0|'Oh you hypocrite of a teacher: How will you teach the Beta to the students, when you have never understood the meaning of the Alpha?
CJ|0|287|21|0|Explain the Alpha to Me according to true wisdom, and I will then believe what you have to say about the Beta!
CJ|0|287|22|0|And so you may now find out that I have no need to learn the letters and their origin and meaning from you, I will explain them and show you the true meaning of the letters!'
CJ|0|287|23|0|Here the little Jesus began to expound the whole alphabet to the altogether befuddled teacher and, as He went along, also inquired diligently of him whether he had comprehended it.
CJ|0|287|24|0|But each answer of the teacher was so foolish and incomplete that all those present broke out in ringing laughter thereat.
CJ|0|287|25|0|And since the teacher discovered such amazing wisdom in the Boy, and saw that he had brought disgrace upon himself, he stood up and confessed to those present,
CJ|0|287|26|0|'Oh woe is me, a poor wretch! I am now completely confused. I have brought disgrace, ridicule and harm to myself, because I wanted to bring this little Boy into my school.
CJ|0|287|27|0|Oh brother Joseph, take the Boy away from me; for I can never bear the sternness of His countenance nor the incisiveness of His speech.
CJ|0|287|28|0|Truly, this little Boy is not born of the earth. He must surely be able to tame fire and water in His wisdom.
CJ|0|287|29|0|I will be a fool always if He was not born long before the creation of the world! Jehovah will know in which mother's body He was carried, and which bosom has nourished Him.
CJ|0|287|30|0|Woe is me! I am already a fool - I came to enroll a student, and behold, I have found a Teacher whose Spirit I shall never be able to aspire to. Oh feel the disgrace with me, friends! An old man was made a fool of by a little Boy - that is certainly my death.
CJ|0|287|31|0|Therefore, oh Joseph, take the Boy away from me; for He must be something tremendous, either a God or an angel!'
CJ|0|287|32|0|Here all those present now began to console the teacher, for they felt sorry for him because of his great distress.
CJ|0|288|1|1|Where Is Up - And Where Down?
CJ|0|288|1|0|WHEN JESUS HEARD such lament from Piras Zachaeus, He smiled and said:
CJ|0|288|2|0|'Now your vanities shall bear their fruits, and they who were blind of heart shall receive their sight!
CJ|0|288|3|0|So then listen, o foolish one, you who carry Dumas in your eye like a thorn.
CJ|0|288|4|0|See, I am come down from above so I may judge men according to the world in them,
CJ|0|288|5|0|but after that appeal to their higher nature according to the mandate of Him who is within Me, over Me, and you,
CJ|0|288|6|0|who sent Me from Himself in Me, so that you would be saved!'
CJ|0|288|7|0|After these words of the Boy Jesus all those in the entire surrounding country who lay abed with any sort of illness became well.
CJ|0|288|8|0|Thus also all were freed whose worldliness had at various times been smitten with the judgment of the little Jesus, with the exception of the shriveled boy.
CJ|0|288|9|0|The latter had to spend the three set years under the judgment of the little Boy because of his father.
CJ|0|288|10|0|Piras Zachaeus now arose, went with Joseph out into the open and there inquired of him,
CJ|0|288|11|0|'Brother, we are now in the open and no one can overhear us.
CJ|0|288|12|0|I therefore entreat you, dear brother, that you tell me what the circumstances are in the case of the Boy;
CJ|0|288|13|0|for as I have said before, that is no natural Child!'
CJ|0|288|14|0|Here Joseph answered, 'Friend, see, if I were to talk about the nature of my little Boy, I would not get through in many days;
CJ|0|288|15|0|and besides, the Child does not allow me to break a confidence either just because I have a mind to.
CJ|0|288|16|0|Look, the little Boy is just coming over to us now.
CJ|0|288|17|0|Gather courage and love toward Him, and He will make everything known to you which will be good for your soul!'
CJ|0|288|18|0|Here the teacher soon gathered courage and love toward the Boy, and when the Latter had come over he spoke to Him and said,
CJ|0|288|19|0|'My most captivating, wonderful little Boy!'
CJ|0|288|20|0|And the little Boy smiled and asked, 'Do you know, learned man, where up and where down is?
CJ|0|288|21|0|See, the earth is round like a ball, and round about it people and creatures dwell.
CJ|0|288|22|0|Some live up, and the others down. And the earth revolves daily abouts its center, and every day you are carried around about four thousand miles. Say, when are you up and when down?'
CJ|0|288|23|0|Here the teacher looked greatly befuddled at such unheard-of things and did not know what he should say thereto.
CJ|0|288|24|0|But the little Boy laughed at the dumbfounded expression of Piras Zachaeus and continued,
CJ|0|288|25|0|'Oh you learned man! What are you going to teach, if you do not know that the light alone is the deciding factor there?
CJ|0|288|26|0|Where there is light - there is up; but where there is night - there is down.
CJ|0|288|27|0|Now with you it is still night, so you are at the bottom. But I have always been uppermost in the light; so you probably will be able to comprehend My Essence of light just as little in your night, as those whose feet are opposite ours and who now have night are able to see.' - Thereupon the little Jesus went away.
CJ|0|288|28|0|Piras Zachaeus then asserted to Joseph, 'Now we have it. - Now I know as much as before. - Strange talk of the Boy. Just leave me alone now - I want to think about that.' And Joseph left the teacher alone in the garden.
CJ|0|289|1|1|A Light To The Heathen, A Judgment To The Jews
CJ|0|289|1|0|FOR A WHOLE HOUR Piras Zachaeus thought about the words of the little Boy, but nowhere could he find a solution.
CJ|0|289|2|0|'Just who is this Boy supposed to be?' he said to himself a number of times.
CJ|0|289|3|0|'Could He be none other than Elias, who is supposed to come once more?
CJ|0|289|4|0|Or is He Samuel or some other great prophet reincarnated?
CJ|0|289|5|0|He was born in Bethlehem, and no prophet is to come from there.
CJ|0|289|6|0|But that is the place from which the Messiah is supposed to come!
CJ|0|289|7|0|'Could this Boy then be the Messiah Himself?
CJ|0|289|8|0|The Messiah is supposed to come from the tribe of David! Now Joseph is said to be a rightful descendant of David,
CJ|0|289|9|0|although this has not been established from a strictly legal point of view.
CJ|0|289|10|0|The matter would seem to have much in its favor;
CJ|0|289|11|0|but who can believe and accept this as an undeniable fact without historical proof?
CJ|0|289|12|0|Still, one is almost forced to this conclusion by the very nature of the Boy.
CJ|0|289|13|0|But on the other hand, the Roman charter speaks wholly against this;
CJ|0|289|14|0|for the Messiah will surely have to be a most decided enemy of the Romans.
CJ|0|289|15|0|Now how can the Boy possibly be that in the light of His friendship with the Romans, who have made Him one of their citizens?
CJ|0|289|16|0|As such He can, in time, probably become a great general of Rome, a Messiah to the heathen -
CJ|0|289|17|0|but for us a two-edged sword that will bring about our downfall!
CJ|0|289|18|0|If I reported that to the high priest, truly, that could be of great advantage to me.'
CJ|0|289|19|0|Here the little Jesus, accompanied by James, came back into the garden, went over to the teacher and warned him,
CJ|0|289|20|0|'Piras Zachaeus! Just forget your desire to reveal Me to the high priest before the appointed time;
CJ|0|289|21|0|or death will overtake you at the third step!
CJ|0|289|22|0|My power you have probed, so let this be a good word of warning to you.
CJ|0|289|23|0|Now what you have said to yourself about a Messiah for the heathen, that has its reason -
CJ|0|289|24|0|for thus it shall indeed be: a light to the heathen and a judgment to the Jews and all children of Israel!
CJ|0|289|25|0|This provoked the teacher and he declared, 'If so, then leave us and go to the heathen!'
CJ|0|289|26|0|And the little Jesus retorted, 'I am a Lord and do as I decide; and you are not one who has anything to say about it!
CJ|0|289|27|0|Therefore be silent and leave this place, or you will yet force Me to smite you!'
CJ|0|289|28|0|When Piras Zachaeus heard this from the little Jesus, he quickly arose and fled into the town.
CJ|0|289|29|0|Thus Joseph was rid of an annoying guest and again followed his trade.
CJ|0|290|1|1|The Death And Reawakening Of Zenon
CJ|0|290|1|0|AFTER SOME TIME, the love of the neighboring children and of their parents again drew them over to Joseph -
CJ|0|290|2|0|chiefly on the days before the Sabbath, or Friday, when very little or no work was done, especially in the afternoon.
CJ|0|290|3|0|One such day several neighbors came over with their children.
CJ|0|290|4|0|The girls found the five adopted daughters of Cyrenius to be very delightful company, for they were truly friendly, lovely and industrious, and were well informed in all matters.
CJ|0|290|5|0|With the boys the charming and lively Jesus counted above everything else;
CJ|0|290|6|0|for besides teaching them a number of highly ingenious games which greatly entertained them,
CJ|0|290|7|0|He often told them such moving stories in the form of parables that the little children were all eyes and ears thereat.
CJ|0|290|8|0|Now this time, since the earth was still moist from a recent thunderstorm, the roof (which was flat and was encompassed with a parapet) was chosen as a place to play.
CJ|0|290|9|0|For a while matters went quite peacefully, for the little Jesus told several highly entertaining little stories.
CJ|0|290|10|0|But towards evening matters became more lively on the roof, for the little Jesus had arranged a game of hop-scotch which frequently required some jumping.
CJ|0|290|11|0|Among the twelve boys present was a certain Zenon, a stormy petrel who always wanted to win the few savings pennies brought along by his playmates away from them by all sorts of dare-devil undertakings.
CJ|0|290|12|0|Such an undertaking he also put into effect on this occasion, namely that he wagered eleven pennies, and that against the will of the Lord Jesus,
CJ|0|290|13|0|that he could go around the roof on the parapet three times without losing his balance.
CJ|0|290|14|0|Should he get around successfully three times, the other eleven children looking on would have to add another eleven pennies to his eleven;
CJ|0|290|15|0|but if he should lose his balance and fall, he would lose his eleven pennies.
CJ|0|290|16|0|The other boys accepted the wager, and Zenon promptly hopped on the parapet, immediately became slightly dizzy, lost his balance, fell to the ground, broke his neck and was dead on the spot.
CJ|0|290|17|0|At this the dead boy's parents, filled with sorrow and anger, ran up to the roof where they seized Jesus and wanted to maltreat him.
CJ|0|290|18|0|But Jesus tore free of them, ran down to the dead boy and there called loudly,
CJ|0|290|19|0|'Zenon! Get up and witness for Me to your blind parents whether I have thrown you down and killed you!'
CJ|0|290|20|0|At this the dead boy promptly arose and declared,
CJ|0|290|21|0|'O Lord! You have never thrown me down and killed me,
CJ|0|290|22|0|but my desire for gain and my unseemly haste were responsible for that!
CJ|0|290|23|0|And when this my sin killed me then You, o Lord, did in fact come to me and restore my life!'
CJ|0|290|24|0|When the parents of Zenon heard this witness, they immediately fell down before Jesus and worshiped the power of God in the Child Jesus.
CJ|0|290|25|0|Here Jesus admonished Zenon, 'Let that be a lesson to you and in the future have no part in such games, which tempt death, and remember that I advised you against it!'
CJ|0|290|26|0|The parents and Zenon wept from sheer gratitude and then went home.
CJ|0|290|27|0|(Moreover, this was a prophetic intimation of Judas Iscariot, which may easily be discerned.)
CJ|0|291|1|1|Archelaus - A Scourge Of God
CJ|0|291|1|0|ANOTHER TIME, again on the day before the Sabbath, several neighbors came to Joseph with their children so they might consult with him about several matters which were pressing them;
CJ|0|291|2|0|for these neighbors knew that Joseph was on very good terms with the prefect.
CJ|0|291|3|0|It was about this time that Joseph received a letter from Cyrenius in Tyre, who upon his return from Rome inquired about the welfare of Joseph and especially about the little Jesus.
CJ|0|291|4|0|Concerning this letter the neighbors knew nothing,
CJ|0|291|5|0|nor did they know that Joseph was such a great friend of the governor Cyrenius.
CJ|0|291|6|0|Here Joseph wanted to display the letter to them and thus give his neighbors a sure consolation,
CJ|0|291|7|0|since he wanted to show them therewith how most effectively he would take their part with the governor against the tenant king,
CJ|0|291|8|0|and that all the more surely with the best results because Eudokia and the five maidens belonged wholly to Cyrenius.
CJ|0|291|9|0|At that moment the little Jesus quickly spoke to Joseph and said in an impassioned manner,
CJ|0|291|10|0|'Joseph, Joseph, never do that, for I am the Lord!
CJ|0|291|11|0|If you show the letter, then I shall smite the earth - for I am the Lord also over Rome, and not Cyrenius, and not Augustus Caesar.
CJ|0|291|12|0|I tell you: If the people were better than the tenant king, I then would know how to take care of Archelaus.
CJ|0|291|13|0|But since the people are not an iota better, just let them bear their own burden in the tenant king, who is a miser like the entire people.
CJ|0|291|14|0|'Was it not said: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and so forth? So let it also be said: greed for greed, jealousy for jealousy.
CJ|0|291|15|0|Accordingly Archelaus is indeed a true physician to this hard-hearted people, and he shall remain as he is until his end!'
CJ|0|291|16|0|These words vexed the neighbors, and they said,
CJ|0|291|17|0|'That would be a rare fellow of a Messiah for us!
CJ|0|291|18|0|Us He scolds and therefore praises the heathen Archelaus!'
CJ|0|291|19|0|Thereupon the little Jesus stamped His heel into the ground and commanded,
CJ|0|291|20|0|'Earth, quake, so your blind children may know that It is I, your Lord!'
CJ|0|291|21|0|And suddenly fire escaped the stamped spot, and the ground quaked mightily.
CJ|0|291|22|0|At this all those present took fright and asked, 'Just What really is that Child? For the earth actually quakes before Him.
CJ|0|291|23|0|Let us depart from here, for it is not safe to be near this Child!' - And all soon left Joseph and hurried away. - And thus Joseph was again freed from a great danger.
CJ|0|292|1|1|The Reawakening Of Salome's Dead Servant
CJ|0|292|1|0|WHEN JESUS WAS a little over six years old, Salome had a dead tree felled and then had it split and cut up by her men-servants for firewood.
CJ|0|292|2|0|On this occasion a young man-servant who was quite proud of his capacity to work said to his three fellow-servants,
CJ|0|292|3|0|'Just leave this work of splitting to me, and I will be done with the whole tree as quickly as the three of you together!'
CJ|0|292|4|0|And the other servants gladly left this honor to him.
CJ|0|292|5|0|He then took his sharp axe and chopped away very industriously.
CJ|0|292|6|0|But in his zeal he missed a swing and instead of the wood struck his foot and split it from toe to heel.
CJ|0|292|7|0|At this he sank to the ground and screamed for help, and everyone rushed over to him, but no one had anything with which to bandage his foot.
CJ|0|292|8|0|And thus the young man soon lost all of his blood and thereupon died.
CJ|0|292|9|0|In the meantime Joseph's house also heard the shouting and lament at the near-by house of Salome.
CJ|0|292|10|0|And Jesus ran over quickly and pushed through the surrounding crowd to the already dead servant.
CJ|0|292|11|0|Upon reaching the dead man, He quickly seized his split foot, pressed it firmly together and healed it in an instant.
CJ|0|292|12|0|When the foot was healed in this manner, He seized the servant's hand and said,
CJ|0|292|13|0|'Listen, you vain young man! I say to you: Arise and continue to split your wood!
CJ|0|292|14|0|But from now on give up your vanity and never desire to labor beyond your strength,
CJ|0|292|15|0|and you will easily guard yourself from similar accidents in the future;
CJ|0|292|16|0|for your fellow-servants also have the strength for their work from God, and you shall not put them to shame, anytime or anywhere.
CJ|0|292|17|0|'Now if one of your fellow servants is intentionally lazy and idle, the Lord will be sure to find him;
CJ|0|292|18|0|but it shall never be up to you to set yourself up as his judge by vain and overdone industry.'
CJ|0|292|19|0|Here the young servant arose once more in full strength and resumed splitting wood.
CJ|0|292|20|0|Thereupon all those present fell down on their knees before the Boy Jesus and said,
CJ|0|292|21|0|'Praise and honor to the power of God in You; for the Lord has already bestowed the fullness of divine power upon You at an early age!'
CJ|0|292|22|0|And Jesus quickly returned to His home, for he did not want the praise of men.
CJ|0|293|1|1|The Broken Water Jug
CJ|0|293|1|0|NOW MARY still had the jug wherein she carried water when the angel delivered the most holy message to her.
CJ|0|293|2|0|She had a high regard for this jug - indeed it was a downright sacred relic to her,
CJ|0|293|3|0|and she did not even like to have anyone take this jug and drink from it.
CJ|0|293|4|0|And one time, about eight days after the wonder had taken place at Salome's, Mary was alone in the house with Jesus.
CJ|0|293|5|0|She was busy washing and needed fresh water,
CJ|0|293|6|0|so she went over to Jesus and said to Him, 'You could easily get me a jug full of fresh water -
CJ|0|293|7|0|here, You may even use this jug which was sanctified through You!'
CJ|0|293|8|0|Jesus took the jug and went to the well with it, near which Joseph was performing a few chores with the other children.
CJ|0|293|9|0|Hereupon Jesus hit the jug somewhat roughly against a rock, and it fell to the ground broken in many pieces.
CJ|0|293|10|0|One of the girls saw this and said, 'Ouch, oh, oh! That will be bad - now the holy jug of the housemistress is gone! - But my dear Jesus, why were You not more careful?
CJ|0|293|11|0|My, but mother will be cross with You for that! Oh, oh, You can really look forward to that!'
CJ|0|293|12|0|This seemed to irk Jesus somewhat, and He said to the girl,
CJ|0|293|13|0|'What is it to you what I do? - You just see to it that you finish your spinning.
CJ|0|293|14|0|I shall still bring plenty of fresh water to Mary despite the broken jug.'
CJ|0|293|15|0|And the girl declared, 'I certainly would like to see just how one can bring fresh water into the house without a jug.'
CJ|0|293|16|0|Here Jesus quickly took His little red coat, gathered it together at the ends, dipped water with it and carried it into the house to Mary without losing a drop.
CJ|0|293|17|0|And they all followed Him into the house because of this wonder.
CJ|0|293|18|0|When Mary saw this, she was shocked and asked, 'But Child, what happened to the jug?'
CJ|0|293|19|0|And Jesus answered, 'See, that has long been a thorn in My eye! Therefore I tested its miraculous power against a rock -
CJ|0|293|20|0|and lo, there was none about nor in it; so it immediately broke into little pieces.
CJ|0|293|21|0|Now I would say that where I am, I certainly should be considered as more important than some stupid jug, which is not an iota better than any other.'
CJ|0|293|22|0|To these words Mary said no more and engraved them deep into her heart.
CJ|0|293|23|0|The girl did not say any more either; for she loved Jesus.
CJ|0|293|24|0|And Jesus said to her, 'See, that way I like you better than when you wag your tongue needlessly.' - And the girl was content with this little rebuke and thereupon spun her yarn industriously.
CJ|0|294|1|1|The Thousand-fold Harvest
CJ|0|294|1|0|AFTER THIS WONDER Jesus remained inactive for about two years and obeyed Joseph and Mary in all things.
CJ|0|294|2|0|And in His eighth year a very bad harvest year appeared; for a great dry spell came, and all the green crops withered.
CJ|0|294|3|0|It was already the seventh month, and nothing green was to be seen anywhere; in many cases the cattle had to be slaughtered, or it became necessary to have hay and grain brought from Egypt and Asia Minor at a high price.
CJ|0|294|4|0|Joseph himself lived mainly from the fish that Jonathan brought him every week, and fed his domestic animals with the reed grass which Jonathan also sent him.
CJ|0|294|5|0|Finally clouds appeared in the seventh month, and it began to rain sparingly now and then.
CJ|0|294|6|0|Joseph thereupon told his four oldest sons, 'Harness the oxen to the plow, and we will sow some wheat into the ground in the name of the Lord.
CJ|0|294|7|0|Who knows, perhaps the Lord will still bless it, since we may after all count Him as our Son and Brother whom He sent into the world.
CJ|0|294|8|0|To be sure, He has not worked any wonders through Him now for two years, so that we already have as good as forgotten His eminence on that account;
CJ|0|294|9|0|but who knows, whether this bad year is not the result of our forgetfulness toward Him who so divinely came to us from above!'
CJ|0|294|10|0|Here the now eight year old Jesus went over to Joseph and said to him, 'Good, father Joseph! All of you have never forgotten Me; therefore I will go with you to lay the wheat into the furrows!'
CJ|0|294|11|0|This made Joseph very happy indeed; and Mary and all the others in the house declared,
CJ|0|294|12|0|'Yes, yes, where the dear Jesus will sow, a rich harvest will surely come up!'
CJ|0|294|13|0|And Jesus agreed smilingly, 'I am of that opinion too. Truly, in vain shall no seed fall into the ground by Me.'
CJ|0|294|14|0|Hereupon the plowing and sowing began. Joseph sowed to the left of the plow, and Jesus to the right.
CJ|0|294|15|0|And thus the acre was fully cultivated in half a day.
CJ|0|294|16|0|Soon thereafter a plentiful rain fell, and the wheat sprang up after taking a firm hold and as a summer crop came to a very gratifying maturity in three months.
CJ|0|294|17|0|And here it was noted that the ears which the Boy Jesus had sown on the right-hand side had five hundred kernels throughout, while those of Joseph had only thirty to forty kernels.
CJ|0|294|18|0|At this all were greatly surprised, and when the grain was finally threshed out on the threshing-floor, only then did the blessing of God show itself in full measure:
CJ|0|294|19|0|For from each measure of wheat that was sown, exactly one thousand measures were reaped: a harvest which no one had ever experienced!
CJ|0|294|20|0|And since Joseph had such a great supply, he kept seventy measures of wheat for himself and distributed nine hundred and thirty measures among the neighbors.
CJ|0|294|21|0|And therewith an entire locality was helped with this wonderful harvest.
CJ|0|294|22|0|And many neighbors came and praised and honored the power of God in the Boy Jesus.
CJ|0|294|23|0|But the Latter admonished them towards love to God and to their neighbors and said to everyone, 'Love is better than praise, and a proper piety towards God is worth more than a burnt offering!' - During this time the withered boy also regained his health.
CJ|0|295|1|1|A Memorable School Episode
CJ|0|295|1|0|FOLLOWING THIS the Boy Jesus worked no more wonders, but was like all other children of men;
CJ|0|295|2|0|for He liked to be with Joseph, who made such implements as: plows, yokes, chairs, tables, beds and the like, and never failed to make anything right.
CJ|0|295|3|0|Since the Boy was already going into His tenth year and did not seem to be at all different from the other children,
CJ|0|295|4|0|Joseph one day said to Mary, 'See, the people around here speak ill of us because we are letting Jesus grow up without any schooling whatsoever, when He is after all supposed to have such wonderful talents and potentialities!
CJ|0|295|5|0|I well know that Jesus has no need of worldly instruction;
CJ|0|295|6|0|but to cut off the gossip of the neighbors, I would like to apprentice Him to a teacher.
CJ|0|295|7|0|And since two new schools have now been set up in the town, of which both teachers are supposed to be very able, I would like to try out one or the other.'
CJ|0|295|8|0|Mary agreed to this, for she also realized the apparent necessity of it.
CJ|0|295|9|0|And Joseph took Jesus and led Him to one of the teachers.
CJ|0|295|10|0|The latter took charge of the Boy and said to Joseph, 'First, because of the many Greeks among us, He shall learn Greek and only then Hebrew.
CJ|0|295|11|0|I do indeed know of the peculiarities of this Child and am a little afraid of Him.
CJ|0|295|12|0|But just the same I will do what ought to be done; only you must turn the Boy over to me completely.'
CJ|0|295|13|0|To this Joseph agreed and gave Jesus wholly into the teacher's house.
CJ|0|295|14|0|For three days Jesus enjoyed the usual freedom here; and on the fourth day the teacher took Him into the schoolroom.
CJ|0|295|15|0|There he led Him to the blackboard, wrote down the whole alphabet before Him and began to explain it.
CJ|0|295|16|0|After he had explained it through a few times, he asked Jesus what He remembered about it.
CJ|0|295|17|0|But Jesus acted as if He knew nothing of what had been explained, and gave the teacher no answer.
CJ|0|295|18|0|And the teacher plagued the Boy and himself for three days and never received an answer.
CJ|0|295|19|0|But on the fourth day in school he became exasperated and demanded of the Boy Jesus under threat of a sound punishment that He answer him.
CJ|0|295|20|0|Here the Boy Jesus said to him, 'If in truth you are a teacher, and if you really know the meaning of the letters, then show Me the true meaning of the Alpha, and I will tell you that of the Beta!'
CJ|0|295|21|0|At this the teacher became angry and struck Jesus on the head with the ruler.
CJ|0|295|22|0|This hurt the Boy and He demanded of the teacher, 'Is that the proper way to cover up your ignorance?
CJ|0|295|23|0|Truly, I am not with you for the sake of being struck, and that is not the way to teach and educate people!
CJ|0|295|24|0|Now you shall be struck dumb and insane by Me because you, instead of giving Me a proper explanation, struck Me!'
CJ|0|295|25|0|And the teacher sank down on the spot - and, as one raving, was bound and brought into another room.
CJ|0|295|26|0|Jesus then promptly went home to Joseph and there said,
CJ|0|295|27|0|'Another time I would appreciate another teacher who does not come to school with a stick in his hand; for that one now suffers for his misdeed against Me!'
CJ|0|295|28|0|Here Joseph knew what had surely happened again, and said to Mary, 'So then we must not let Jesus out of our hands any more, for He disciplines everyone who is not according to His mind.'
CJ|0|295|29|0|And Mary was satisfied with that, and no one dared to reproach Jesus.
CJ|0|296|1|1|The Boy Jesus Explains Daniel To A Kind Teacher
CJ|0|296|1|0|AFTER A PERIOD of a few weeks the other new teacher came to Joseph to pay him a friendly visit,
CJ|0|296|2|0|for Joseph had previously made him several new benches and chairs and a table for his schoolroom, and on this occasion had won a man of real integrity as his friend.
CJ|0|296|3|0|This teacher now became acquainted with the Boy Jesus also and took great pleasure in His serious but for all that unassuming and cheerful manner.
CJ|0|296|4|0|He therefore inquired of Joseph whether the Boy had already learned to read in any school.
CJ|0|296|5|0|Here Joseph replied, 'Brother, I have already made the attempt with a couple of teachers, but both were unable to accomplish anything with Him;
CJ|0|296|6|0|for a strange power dwells in this Boy.
CJ|0|296|7|0|As soon as a teacher gets a bit rough with Him, he is already lost;
CJ|0|296|8|0|for then only a word from the Boy's mouth needs to come over the teacher, and he is punished in the most severe manner.
CJ|0|296|9|0|This was the case only recently with the first teacher, who is still a madman to this hour.'
CJ|0|296|10|0|And the teacher rejoined, 'Yes, yes, I know that indeed; but he was also a tyrant toward all his students.
CJ|0|296|11|0|If I instructed the Boy, truly, I would have no fear of being punished by Him.'
CJ|0|296|12|0|Here the Boy Jesus, who was present, asked, 'What really would you teach Me?'
CJ|0|296|13|0|And the teacher in a very loving manner drew the Boy over to himself, caressed Him and assured Him,
CJ|0|296|14|0|'I would in an indeed friendly manner like to teach You to read and write and then to understand the Scripture.'
CJ|0|296|15|0|And the Boy said, 'Good, if you have anything from the Scripture with you, then give it to Me, and I will give you a demonstration!'
CJ|0|296|16|0|Here the teacher promptly drew out a scroll - the book of Daniel - and gave it to the Boy.
CJ|0|296|17|0|The Latter immediately began to read the scroll and also to explain it, so that all those present as well as the greatly taken-aback teacher were astonished beyond measure.
CJ|0|296|18|0|Now when the teacher had heard this from the Boy, he asserted,
CJ|0|296|19|0|'O Lord! Be gracious and merciful to me a poor sinner, for this Boy is no earthly human being!
CJ|0|296|20|0|Oh brother Joseph, now I plainly understand why no teacher is able to hold out with this Boy.
CJ|0|296|21|0|The Boy understands more anyhow than all the teachers in the whole world together. Oh be sure to keep Him at home.'
CJ|0|296|22|0|This testimony pleased the Boy and he affirmed, 'Since you are so sincere, the other teacher shall get well again because of you. - So be it! -
CJ|0|296|23|0|Now you remain as sincere in your heart as you now are, and you will be the right sort of a teacher at all times. Amen.'
CJ|0|296|24|0|Thereupon the Boy Jesus left, and the teacher also soon took his leave from Joseph and very thoughtfully went home. - And at the same hour the first teacher's illness began to abate.
CJ|0|297|1|1|Three Miracles Of Jesus In His Eleventh Year
CJ|0|297|1|0|HENCEFORTH the Boy Jesus remained at home, conducted Himself quietly, was obedient and performed small tasks.
CJ|0|297|2|0|He did nothing miraculous for a whole year - or until His eleventh year.
CJ|0|297|3|0|And in His eleventh year He again worked three considerable wonders, which are briefly told as follows.
CJ|0|297|4|0|In the spring Joseph's supply of firewood ran out,
CJ|0|297|5|0|and since James and Jesus had the most time to spare, he sent them into a nearby wood to gather brushwood,
CJ|0|297|6|0|whereupon both went into the wood and busily fulfilled Joseph's wish.
CJ|0|297|7|0|On this occasion James was very active indeed and little remained for Jesus to gather as James anticipated Him everywhere.
CJ|0|297|8|0|And amid such zeal it happened that James reached toward some thick brushwood, beneath which lay a poisonous adder.
CJ|0|297|9|0|The adder bit James in the hand, and he fell over from shock and fright. His hand suddenly swelled up, he arched his back and signs of death appeared.
CJ|0|297|10|0|At this Jesus sprang over, blew into the wound, and James was immediately restored.
CJ|0|297|11|0|Thereupon the adder swelled up horribly and burst.
CJ|0|297|12|0|Following this Jesus said to James, 'Take your time! Remember that death lies in all worldly labor if it is followed too zealously!
CJ|0|297|13|0|For it is better to be lazy for the world but all the more eager for the spirit at every opportunity.
CJ|0|297|14|0|And therefore those too zealous for the world shall always find the death of their souls in their eagerness for worldly things!
CJ|0|297|15|0|'For I shall seek out the idlers in worldly matters and take them into My service forever; and to those who have worked only one hour of the day, I shall give the same wages as to those who have worked most industriously the whole day through.
CJ|0|297|16|0|Fortunate is every idler for this world; but woe to everyone who is zealous for the world! The first will be My friend - and the second My enemy!'
CJ|0|297|17|0|James remembered these words and lived according to them, and did not take it to heart when he was sometimes called an idler and a loafer;
CJ|0|297|18|0|for from then on he was occupied all the more industriously in his heart and made an infinitely great gain thereby. -
CJ|0|297|19|0|Two days after this a neighbor woman, a widow, lost her only small son, and she wept greatly.
CJ|0|297|20|0|At this Jesus with His James also went there to see the dead boy.
CJ|0|297|21|0|But when He saw the violently weeping widow He had compassion with her, seized the dead boy by the hand and called out,
CJ|0|297|22|0|'Kephas! I tell you: arise, and never sadden your mother's heart!' - And the boy suddenly arose and smilingly greeted all those present.
CJ|0|297|23|0|At this the widow was greatly amazed, and she asked, 'Oh, just who is this Son of Joseph, that He is able to raise the dead with one word? Is He a God or an angel?'
CJ|0|297|24|0|Here Jesus said to the widow, 'Ask no more, but give Kephas milk, so he will become completely well.'
CJ|0|297|25|0|And the widow promptly went and brought the boy warmed-up milk.
CJ|0|297|26|0|Thereupon all those present wanted to worship Jesus, but He hastened away, met other children and played with them in a very wise manner. -
CJ|0|297|27|0|And as He was thus playing, one of several carpenters from Nazareth who were repairing a nearby house fell down from it, broke his neck and was dead on the spot.
CJ|0|297|28|0|At this a crowd of people promptly gathered and pitied the unfortunate one, and there was a great commotion.
CJ|0|297|29|0|When Jesus heard this, He also went over with James, pushed His way over to the dead man and called to him,
CJ|0|297|30|0|'Mallas! I tell you: stand up again and do your work! But nail your laths on better, or you will fall once more.
CJ|0|297|31|0|It does not matter how much you have worked, but how you have worked. For death is always inherent in envy!'
CJ|0|297|32|0|Thereupon Jesus went away quickly, and the man who was dead arose in good health and continued to work as ably as if nothing had happened to him. And he kept the words of Jesus in his heart.
CJ|0|297|33|0|These three wonders followed one another within a short period of time, and all the neighbors wanted to worship Jesus therefor.
CJ|0|297|34|0|But Jesus forbade them this and did not appear in the village for several weeks ...
CJ|0|297|35|0|These three miracles were well remembered and were much discussed in Joseph's house.
CJ|0|298|1|1|Twelve-Year-Old Jesus Journeys To The Temple
CJ|0|298|1|0|FROM that time onward Jesus withdrew Himself and worked no more open wonders until the time of the marriage at Cana in Galilee.
CJ|0|298|2|0|Only in His twelfth year the Boy Jesus, when He came to Jerusalem for the first time during the holidays as told in the Gospel, worked a wonder among the scholars in the temple through His wisdom.
CJ|0|298|3|0|Which wonder I, James, since I was not present, had the Lord describe to me only later, which briefly told was as follows:
CJ|0|298|4|0|In the great crowd Joseph and Mary lost sight of Jesus in the temple and supposed, since He was not with them, that He would surely have traveled homeward with Salome or other relatives and friends.
CJ|0|298|5|0|And thus they both went after the Nazarene caravan and caught up with it only that evening at the inn between Nazareth and Jerusalem.
CJ|0|298|6|0|But since they did not find Jesus there, they became very sad, took a few companions and went back to Jerusalem during the night.
CJ|0|298|7|0|Arrived there, Joseph promptly went to the prefect Cornelius, who at that time still governed in Jerusalem.
CJ|0|298|8|0|Joseph informed Cornelius, who came to meet him in a most friendly manner, what had taken place,
CJ|0|298|9|0|and the latter promptly gave Joseph a Roman guard, with which Joseph was permitted to search through all the houses.
CJ|0|298|10|0|Thus Joseph rummaged through nearly all of Jerusalem and still did not find Jesus, after a search that lasted for three days.
CJ|0|298|11|0|At this both became very much afraid; they sadly returned the guard to Cornelius and would not let themselves be comforted by him.
CJ|0|298|12|0|And since the time was already very late in the afternoon, Cornelius wanted them to remain with him.
CJ|0|298|13|0|But Joseph said, 'Oh noble friend, I will of course stay with you this night; but first I must go up to the temple and there make an offering to the Lord God from and in my sad heart.'
CJ|0|298|14|0|At this Cornelius let Joseph and Mary go up into the temple.
CJ|0|298|15|0|And behold, there they found Jesus sitting among the learned elders, as He questioned them, taught them and gave them such answers to their questions that all were greatly amazed thereat;
CJ|0|298|16|0|for He taught them the obscure passages from the prophets, taught them about the stars, about their courses, about their fundamental light, about their second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh light.
CJ|0|298|17|0|Thus He also described to them the nature of the worlds and showed them the physical, psychic and spiritual correlation of all things,
CJ|0|298|18|0|and established the immortality of the soul to them in such an unprecedented manner, that all said thereto,
CJ|0|298|19|0|'Truly, this has never been heard before! A Boy of twelve is wiser in one finger than all of us together!'
CJ|0|298|20|0|At this Joseph and Mary went over to Jesus and said to Him,
CJ|0|298|21|0|'But how could You do this to us? See, we have searched for You in great anguish for three days and could not find You!'
CJ|0|298|22|0|Here Jesus said, 'Why did you do that? (Namely the search outside of the temple with the aid of the soldiers).
CJ|0|298|23|0|Had you never heard of My Father's house, and that I had to do therein what concerned My Father?'
CJ|0|298|24|0|And neither of them understood these words; but Jesus willingly followed them home at once, after He had first stayed with them that night at the home of Cornelius.
CJ|0|298|25|0|And the learned men praised Mary happy beyond measure, in that she had such a Child.
CJ|0|298|26|0|From this time onward Jesus withdrew himself altogether and worked no more wonders before men until his thirtieth year, and lived and worked like any other human being.
CJ|0|299|1|1|And He Increased In Grace And Wisdom
CJ|0|299|1|0|NOW IT IS WRITTEN in the Scripture: And He increased in grace and wisdom before God and men and remained subservient and obedient to His parents, until He began His ministry.
CJ|0|299|2|0|Question: How could Jesus, as the only eternal Supreme Being, increase in grace and wisdom before God and men, when He actually was God from eternity;
CJ|0|299|3|0|and how especially before men, since He was the infinitely most perfect Being from eternity?
CJ|0|299|4|0|To understand this correctly, Jesus must not be looked upon exclusively as the only God;
CJ|0|299|5|0|but He must be seen as a man in whom the sole eternal Deity imprisoned Itself as seemingly inactive, just as the spirit is imprisoned in the nature of every man.
CJ|0|299|6|0|And what every man must do according to the divine order to free the spirit within himself,
CJ|0|299|7|0|that the man Jesus also had to do in all earnestness in order to free the Supreme Being within himself, so that he might become one with Him.
CJ|0|299|8|0|Now every man must carry certain weaknesses within himself, which are the common bonds of the spirit by which it is confined as though within a tight shell.
CJ|0|299|9|0|These bonds can only be burst asunder when the soul, which is entwined with the flesh, has so strengthened itself through the proper amount of self-denial that it is stable enough to perceive and to hold the free spirit.
CJ|0|299|10|0|This is why man can only become aware of his weaknesses by suffering all manner of temptations and thus discover how and wherein his spirit is fettered.
CJ|0|299|11|0|And when he thereupon denies himself in his soul in these very matters, he thereby frees his spirit of its bonds and binds his soul therewith.
CJ|0|299|12|0|And when, in the course of time, the soul is bound with all the former bonds of the spirit, the completely unfettered spirit quite naturally unites with the entire, now strong soul,
CJ|0|299|13|0|and the latter thereby enters into all perfect, heavenly power of the spirit and thus becomes wholly one with the spirit forever.
CJ|0|299|14|0|For the loosening of one bond after the other constitutes the soul's increase in spiritual strength, which is God's wisdom and God's grace.
CJ|0|299|15|0|God's wisdom consists in the clear beholding of God's eternal order within the self, and His grace in recognizing His eternal light of love, by means of which all of the endless and innumerable things, the conditions of their existence and their paths are illuminated.
CJ|0|299|16|0|And as is the case with man, so it also was with the God-man Jesus.
CJ|0|299|17|0|His soul was like that of every man and was fettered with all the more weaknesses because the most powerful Spirit of God had to bind Himself with the mightiest of bonds so He could be contained within His soul.
CJ|0|299|18|0|Thus the soul of Jesus also had to withstand the greatest temptations and deny itself in order to take the bonds off its God-Spirit and to gird itself therewith for the infinite freedom of the Spirit of all spirits, so it could become wholly one with Him.
CJ|0|299|19|0|And in just this did the increase in the wisdom and the grace of the soul of Jesus before God and men consist, and that in such measure that the God-Spirit gradually and ever more and more united Himself with His in fact divine soul, which was called the Son of God.
CJ|0|300|1|1|An Exemplary Life Of The Soul
CJ|0|300|1|0|JUST HOW did the Lord Jesus live from His twelfth to His thirtieth year?
CJ|0|300|2|0|He constantly felt the Presence of the almighty Deity within Himself as a living Power; He knew within His soul that everything in the whole creation was and eternally must be subservient to His slightest wish.
CJ|0|300|3|0|Moreover, He felt the greatest urge within His soul to rule over everything.
CJ|0|300|4|0|Pride, a desire for power, for complete freedom of will, for a life of pleasure, for women and for other such infirmities, as well as anger were the chief weaknesses of His soul.
CJ|0|300|5|0|But He fought against all of these powerful and deadly inclinations of His soul from the will of His soul.
CJ|0|300|6|0|He humbled His pride by means of want; but what an indeed harsh measure this was for Him to whom all things belonged, and He nevertheless might not call anything "My own".
CJ|0|300|7|0|He tamed His desire for power through the most willing obedience toward those who like all men were like chaff before Him.
CJ|0|300|8|0|Although it was an infinitely difficult thing for Him to do, He assaulted His eternal, supreme freedom by submitting Himself to men as a slave-like servant to perform the lowliest tasks.
CJ|0|300|9|0|He fought against His most powerful urge to lead a life of pleasure by frequent fasts - from want as well as from the free will of His soul.
CJ|0|300|10|0|He combatted His desire for women through repeated hard work, through simple fare, through prayer and through keeping company with wise men.
CJ|0|300|11|0|Indeed, in this matter He had to carry an exceptionally great burden, for His appearance and the sound of His voice were most captivating,
CJ|0|300|12|0|for which reason the five truly beautiful daughters of Cyrenius were one and all violently in love with Him and vied amongst each other to please Him the most.
CJ|0|300|13|0|Such love did indeed please Him; but for all that He had to say to each at all times: 'Noli Me tangere!'
CJ|0|300|14|0|Furthermore, since He saw through the malice of men at a glance and saw their cunning and hypocrisy, their dishonesty and selfishness,
CJ|0|300|15|0|it is easy to understand that He was quickly aroused and could very easily be hurt and angered;
CJ|0|300|16|0|but here He tempered His divine character with His love and His thereupon following compassion.
CJ|0|300|17|0|And thus He practiced all manner of most arduous self-denial throughout His whole life, so He thereby might rebuild the eternal order which had been shaken to its very foundation.
CJ|0|300|18|0|Thus it can easily be seen how' it was that Jesus as a human being spent these eighteen years amid constant temptations and the combating thereof.
CJ|0|300|19|0|And since this has now been presented in a manner which should be of benefit to everyone, all that remains to be told is the three-day discourse with the wise men and scholars in the temple, but which, as well as a number of other matters, cannot be given at this time.
CJ|0|300|20|0|So be content with this for now, and the other will follow when you say to the servant,
CJ|0|300|21|0|'Come to us, brother, in the name of the Lord, and stay and dwell with us!' -
CJ|0|300|22|0|This work is herewith completed, and I bestow My blessing My grace upon you for ever and always! Amen. Amen. Amen.
