COR|0|1|1|1|Abgarus' first letter to the Lord
COR|0|1|1|0|Abgarus, toparch in Edessa, to Jesus, the good Saviour, Who has appeared in the land around Jerusalem, all hail.
COR|0|1|2|0|I have heard of You and Your healing power, how You perform it without medicines and herbs. For the saying goes that You make the blind see and that the lame walk; that You clean the lepers, and cast out the impure spirits, and heal those, that fight with lingering diseases, and finally even raise the dead.
COR|0|1|3|0|After I heard all these things about You, I concluded for myself, one of two things had to be true, either You are God, descent from heaven; or You, who doest these things, are at least a Son of the great God!
COR|0|1|4|0|I therefore request You through this letter, to take the trouble to come to me, and heal the illness that I have!
COR|0|1|5|0|I also heard that the Jews murmur against You and plot evil against You. I however have a small, but well ordered city, which will be sufficient for both of us; therefore come to me, You my most esteemed friend Jesus, and stay with me in my city and in my country; there You will be carried by everybody on hands and in the heart.
COR|0|1|6|0|I expect You with greatest longing in my heart! - Sent through my most faithful servant Brachus.
COR|0|1|7|1|The Lords answer on this letter of the King Abgarus
COR|0|1|7|0|Abgarus, you are blessed because you have not seen Me, and yet believed in Me! For you see, it is written of Me: that those, who have seen Me, will not believe in Me, and that those, who have not seen Me, believe and may live in eternity!
COR|0|1|8|0|But in regards to your concerns, for which reason you wrote to Me, that I shall come to you, because I am pursued here in the land of the Jews, I say unto you: that this is necessary, because for that reason I came into the world that all this becomes fulfilled in Me, at this location; and that I, in a short while after all this is fulfilled on Me, will ascend to Him, from Whom I came from eternity!
COR|0|1|9|0|Nevertheless be patient in your undemanding illness. However, after My ascension into heaven, I will send a disciple to you that he may heal your illness, and give to you and all who are with you, the true health!
COR|0|1|10|0|Written through Jacob, a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, and send through Brachus, the king's courier out of the region of Gennesaret.
COR|0|1|11|0|Soon after Abgarus received the exceedingly heavenly answer from the Lord Jesus, it so happened, that the kings oldest son and heir to the throne was overcome by a deadly illness to his body, to which all physicians in Edessa said, that it is incurable. - That brought the poor Abgarus nearly to despair. In such overwhelming distress, he wrote the following second letter to the good Saviour Jesus, which read therefore:
COR|0|2|1|1|Abgarus' second letter to the Lord
COR|0|2|1|0|Abgarus, a miserable toparch in Edessa, to Jesus, the good Saviour, Who appeared in the land around Jerusalem, all hail and all God's honour!
COR|0|2|2|0|Oh Jesus, You good Saviour! See, my oldest son, the heir to the throne, who along with me was happy beyond measure on Your arrival in my city, became deadly ill. An evil fever has seized him, and is threatening to kill him any moment! However, I know because the messenger has declared it to me, that from a distance You cure all kind of sick people without medicine just through words and will! Oh Jesus, You good Saviour, You actual Son of the most high God, that You are for certain, let my son who loves You so very much, that he would even go for You into death, become also healthy again through Your powerful word and will!
COR|0|2|3|0|Oh Jesus, You good Saviour! Tell me, I who am also sick, do not announce Your previous mentioned ascension at this time; but help, help, help, my son at once!
COR|0|2|4|0|Written in my city Edessa and send through the former most trusted messenger.
COR|0|2|5|1|On that the following answer from the Lord Jesus reads therefore:
COR|0|2|5|0|Abgarus, great is your belief, and as a result it could become even better with your son. Because I have found love in you, more than in Israel, I therefore want to do more for you, as so only you alone would have believed.
COR|0|2|6|0|See I, the Lord of Eternity, now a teacher to mankind, and an eternal Deliverer from eternal death, will give your son eternal life before My ascent, because he has unseen and unknown loved Me out of his whole heart before My imminent sorrows for all people. And so, My dear Abgarus, you will certainly lose your son according to the flesh in the world, but as to the Spirit will win him a thousand fold in My eternal Kingdom!
COR|0|2|7|0|However, do not believe that your son, so he will die, will seriously die! No, No; but when he dies, he then will at last awake from the death-sleep of this world to the true eternal life in My Kingdom, which is Spiritual and not physical!
COR|0|2|8|0|Therefore, do not grieve in your soul! For see and be quiet, I am alone the Lord, and there is no other beside Me! Therefore I freely do, what I do, and no one can say to Me: do that, or don't do that!
COR|0|2|9|0|However, what I do now and allow, that I am pursued like a weak person, I already planned before the earth was yet established, and before the sun, moon and stars illuminated the earth from the sky! For that reason I went out of My Father, who is in Me like I am in Him! However, the Father is the Highest, because He is My Love, My Will. Though, the Spirit that goes out of Me and the Father causing from eternity to eternity, is the Holiest. And I am All that, Who is revealing this to you!
COR|0|2|10|0|Therefore do not be sad, because now you know Who it is that has revealed such to you! However, be quiet about it until I will be raised up at the stake before the Jews, which will be proclaimed to you soon, for otherwise the world would fall before its time! -
COR|0|2|11|0|In the next few days though, a poor youth will come into your city. Receive him and do him good, and you will delight My heart, because I provided your son with such immense grace, and on account of his love, let him go there before Me, because I will go to the raising on the stake. - Amen.
COR|0|2|12|0|Written at Canaan in Galilee through the disciple John, and send through the king's messenger.
COR|0|3|1|1|Abgarus' third letter to the Lord
COR|0|3|1|0|Abgarus, a small toparch in Edessa, to Jesus the Saviour, Who has appeared in the land around Jerusalem, all hail into eternity.
COR|0|3|2|0|Out of Your lovely merciful letter, that You oh Lord, Lord God of Eternity, have previously and most graciously, before this my letter, sent to me a dust-covered worm and to my sons overwhelming comfort, have I clearly seen, that in You must live the Highest Love; for otherwise it would simply be impossible, that You, as the only Lord of all heavens as well as the earth, me, a worm before You, for my son who loves You over all to have thought of so well, to have given him such an almighty source of comfort! I can to You, oh Lord, for that probably do nothing, than to sink before Your most Holy name in the dust of my nothingness and offer to You my and my sons thanks. Graciously take this our most fervent thanks as a pledge of our most burning love, and think of us always in Your, for me, inconceivable mildness.
COR|0|3|3|0|My very sick son's love to You has expressed to me a loving desire for You a couple of days ago. Lord, forgive me that I again through this letter make it known to You! I very well know that our thoughts are already much sooner known to You, before my son and I have thought of them; but putting that aside I write You, as if one writes a person, and I do that after the advice of that poor young person which was recommended to me by You, who is now already positioned with me, and who said to me, that everyone must come to You this way, who wants to receive something from You!
COR|0|3|4|0|This young person professed to have seen You; he has in fact a very simple, but otherwise, how it appears to me, a very correct and appropriate gift of description. This young person has become very valuable to me as a result of his ability, and recently to our joy described to us Your appearance in a very graphic manner, that I and my son, who is still alive, but already quite weak, believed to have literally seen You. However, in my city lives a very great artist painter; he painted for me at once, after the description of the young person, Your head with chest. My son and I were surprised and greatly pleased by this picture, then the poor young person professed, that You, oh Lord, look just like it!
COR|0|3|5|0|That is why I am using this opportunity, through the trusted bearer of this my due letter of thanks to send You Your self-image, on that You would verify it Yourself, and then let me know through the messenger, whether this picture possibly looks like You?
COR|0|3|6|0|Oh Lord Jesus, You good Saviour of all mankind! For that reason do not be angry with us; for not a contemptuous curiosity, no, but rather pure mighty love to You drove us to have it made, this the most valuable gem of our heart, so that we can make for ourselves some kind of picture of You, because You have fulfilled our hearts into the deepest depth with Your love, and You became our greatest wealth, our greatest solace, and our hearts most precious brides-ornaments in life and in death!
COR|0|3|7|0|Oh Lord, never stop remembering us in Your heart; may Your Holy Will be done for us!
COR|0|3|8|1|The Lord Jesus' third answer to the King Abgarus, which was send within ten days through the same messenger of the king.
COR|0|3|8|0|My blessing, My Love and My Grace to you, My beloved son Abgarus!
COR|0|3|9|0|I have here in Judea said very often to them, whom I helped of all kinds of ills of the body: See, your belief did that! But, I have never asked anyone: Do you love Me? And thus far no one has said out of the depth of their heart: Lord, I love you!
COR|0|3|10|0|You though already believed long before, without having seen Me, that I am the only One, and now you love Me, like one who has long been re-born out of the Fire of the Spirit.
COR|0|3|11|0|Oh Abgarus! Abgarus! If only you would, and you could grasp it, how much I love you for that, and what a great joy you make to My eternal Fathers-heart, a greater bliss would consequently overwhelm you, that you could never live again!
COR|0|3|12|0|However, be steadfast in all, what you will gradually hear of Me from the wicked Jews, who soon will deliver Me into the hands of the hangman. However, when you hear all this, and do not become annoyed over it, then will you spiritually be the first, after your son, who will have a living part in My resurrection from death.
COR|0|3|13|0|Truly, truly I say unto you: those who believe in My teaching, that it has come out from God, they shall also be raised from the dead on the Youngest Day, under these circumstances everyone will find his just sentence. But those that love Me like you do will never taste death! Just as quickly as the fastest thought, so also will they be transfigured out of this life of the body into the very brightest eternal life, and will take up residence with Me, their Father for eternity! However, carefully keep such a secret with you, until I have been resurrected!
COR|0|3|14|0|Then soon after that a disciple will come to you, like I promised you in the first letter, and will except for your son, who will go before Me without pain into My Kingdom, make you and your entire household bodily and spiritually healthy.
COR|0|3|15|0|In regard to the resemblance between My outer form and through your messenger send picture of Me, is true or not, will your messenger, who has already seen Me now for the third time, most loyally inform you of. Whoever wants a picture of Me with your like intentions, there is no sin in it! Since love bears all. But woe unto them who make an idol out of Me. But keep the picture a secret!
COR|0|3|16|0|Written in Judea through one of My disciples, who is close to My heart, and again send through the same messenger.
COR|0|3|17|0|My well being to your household. -Amen.
COR|0|4|1|1|King Abgarus' fourth letter to the Lord, which was written seven weeks later, after the third.
COR|0|4|1|0|Abgarus, a small toparch in Edessa, to Jesus the good Saviour, Who has appeared in the land around Jerusalem, and is now being persecuted from one end to the other from the dumb, blind Jews, who do not recognize the Holy primeval Light, the Sun of suns in their midst, all hail!
COR|0|4|2|0|Oh You my good Saviour Jesus! Now the reality has set in on my dear son, what You, oh Lord, prophesied to me in the second letter; he died a couple of days ago and insistently begged me on his deathbed with many tears in his eyes, that with this letter I would express to You his most ardent thanks for that, that You have actually allowed him, so totally without pain and completely without the fear of death of the body, to most graciously pass away.
COR|0|4|3|0|He pressed Your picture probably a thousand times on his heart, and his last word was: "Oh You my good Father Jesus! Oh Jesus, the everlasting Love, You alone are the true Life from eternity, You, who now walks like a son of a man under those, which called Your omnipotence into existence, and gave to them shape and life, - You alone, yes You my Love in eternity!!! I live, I live, I live through You in You eternally!!!"
COR|0|4|4|0|After these words my dear son deceased. Obviously You already know, oh Lord, that this was the earthly end of my son, and that my entire household and I cried much for him. But nevertheless I write this to You, akin from person to person, while my dying son before his earthly end has so ardently wished for.
COR|0|4|5|0|Oh Lord, forgive me a poor sinner before You, as I become a burden to You in this forth letter, and cause You, oh Lord, perhaps an intrusion in Your most Holy more important affairs.
COR|0|4|6|0|Finally I venture yet for one more favour in this letter, that You would not withdraw Your consolation from me, please. You see, nevertheless after my son a great sadness has befallen me, of which I, in my firmest and most possible best will, cannot free myself off. Therefore I appeal to You, You good Saviour, You good Father from eternity, You want to make me free from this great pain. But not mine, but rather Your Holy Will be done!
COR|0|4|7|1|Short answer from the Lord on this letter in the Greek tongue, because the earlier letters were written in the Jewish tongue.
COR|0|4|7|0|y beloved son and brother Abgarus! What concerns your son, I already know all, and it is extremely dear to Me, that it has taken such a beautiful end for this world, but yet by far more beautiful beginning in My Kingdom for him.
COR|0|4|8|0|You however do well in that you mourn a little for him; you see, there are very few good people in the world! However, those that are like your son are well worth mourning after!
COR|0|4|9|0|See, also I cry a precious tear after your son! - Moreover, the entire world came out of one tear out of My eye, and so also will the new heaven once again be created.
COR|0|4|10|0|I say to you, there are good tears of mighty value in heaven. For with these most costly jewels, the eternal heaven will be decorated. But the strongholds of hell are strengthened with wicked hate-, envy-, and anger-tears.
COR|0|4|11|0|Therefore let that be your biggest comfort that you mourn about your good son. However keep this grief for a little moment in time, until you briefly mourn after Me; then my disciple will make you free from everything.
COR|0|4|12|0|However, henceforth be very merciful, and you will also find great mercy! Do not forget the poor; for they too are My brothers, you do to them, what you do to Me, and I will forgive you a hundredfold.
COR|0|4|13|0|Seek the Grand, which is my Kingdom, and the little things of this world will be a benefit to you! However, if you seek the little things, you could not be considered valuable for the Grand.
COR|0|4|14|0|You however have a criminal, which after your wise law has earned the death penalty. I however say to you, love and mercy stands superior, than wisdom and justice! Act therefore with him in love and in mercy, and you will be one with Me and with the Father, the One, who dwells in Me, and from Whom I go out, as mortal being the same as you. - Amen.
COR|0|4|15|0|Written by Me in Capernaum, and send to you through your messenger.
COR|0|5|1|1|Approximately three weeks after the Lords answer to the forth letter, King Abgarus sent the fifth letter to the Lord Jesus.
COR|0|5|1|0|bgarus, a small toparch in Edessa, to Jesus, the good Saviour, Who appeared in the land of the Jews around Jerusalem, as the primeval Light, as the eternal primeval Power that newly circumnavigates All, heaven, worlds, creatures - and won't be recognized by the first ones who are called, nevertheless but from those, who have already for thousands of years languished in darkness, all hail from us children of the night!
COR|0|5|2|0|Oh Lord! Which mortal can possibly comprehend the magnitude of Your love to us mankind, who are only Your creatures, out of which love You now want to shape all new, and yet Yourself desires thereby to walk a way, that is for my human concept for God almost impossible and seems to be unthinkable!
COR|0|5|3|0|Even if You're as well here on this earth, which You could scatter away with one breath, as an utterly simple person present under the people, You nevertheless reign and maintain out of Your most inner God-being the entire infinity! And every dust of the earth, each drop in the sea, sun, moon and all numberless stars listen to the all-powerful voice of Your heart, that is the eternal midpoint of all things and beings in the infinity.
COR|0|5|4|0|Oh how endlessly blessed Your disciples must be, to truly recognize You on their brightest spiritual day, like I poor sinner out of my night!
COR|0|5|5|0|Oh if I only wouldn’t be lame at my feet, I would be with You already long ago! But thus my miserable feet became to me a hindrance to my greatest bliss. All this I now gladly bear, because You, oh Lord, have found me so far worthy, to speak with me poor dumb droplet by letter, and to teach me about so many miraculous things, over which one can most certainly only be taught by You, oh Lord, but never from men.
COR|0|5|6|0|What did I possibly know before of a life after death? All sages of the world would not have revealed these riddles to me; for all our polytheism-doctrines have certainly a poetic immortality, which however has little to do with reality, just like an empty dream from another, in which one can soon walk on the ocean, and drive over land in a ship.
COR|0|5|7|0|You, oh Lord, have shown me in word and in action, how after death, this our very fragile body at long last takes its beginning as a most perfect, genuine, freest spiritual life, and never again changes eternally.
COR|0|5|8|0|For this reason though have I now made it also my indispensable task, to You, oh Lord, to present my most proper thank You through this letter, for this endlessly enormous grace, which of course against this Your endlessly enormous grace shatters into the purest nothingness.
COR|0|5|9|0|But what, oh Lord, could I possibly give You, that You would not have given me before?!
COR|0|5|10|0|I think proper thanks out of the heart seem to me to be ones best feature for a human being, because ingratitude is certainly its own full property. Consequently, oh Lord, can I present nothing but my small thanks, but nevertheless with the fullest assurance that I am now ready, to implement all at once in my little kingdom, what You, oh Lord, would most graciously instruct me to do, that I following Your wish, should not only at once remove the notorious state-criminal out of the dungeon, but also immediately enroll him in my school and bring him to my table.
COR|0|5|11|0|Whether I have done right with that or not, as one keeps saying, doing too much of the good things, and to judge that, goes beyond my human understanding. Therefore, oh Lord, do I also come in this letter with this part to You, that You would most graciously give me the right direction about that.
COR|0|5|12|0|My love, my thanks and my childlike obedience to You, oh Lord, You alone, Your Will be done!
COR|0|5|13|1|The Lords very short (and fifth) answer to Abgarus’ letter.
COR|0|5|13|0|Listen My beloved son and brother Abgarus! I now have with Me 72 disciples, under those 12 apostles; but all of them together do not have such discernment as well as you, seeing as you are a heathen, plus have never seen Me, and all the many miracles since I became a human being, from my birth.
COR|0|5|14|0|Therefore be of the utmost hope; for you see, it will happen, that I take away the light from the children, and will give it in abundance to the heathen! For you see, a short time ago I found under the here also living heathens, Greeks and Romans, a belief, which equally in all of Israel cannot be found; love and humility however have now become under the Jews entirely strange characteristics of the human heart, which I hardly ever come across in such masses under you.
COR|0|5|15|0|See, therefore I will take it away from the children and will give it to you, that is, all My Kingdom, temporal and eternal! The children however should nourish themselves of the filth of the world.
COR|0|5|16|0|You would like to make My will in your kingdom a decree; that won’t do before hand; for you see, you need a certain maturity for all things. But My Law is nothing but My Love. If you want to introduce something of Me in your kingdom, then bring in this Law, after that you will have an easy task with My Will. For you see, My Will and My Law are so entirely One, just like I and the Father are entirely One.
COR|0|5|17|0|Certainly there are yet a good many things that lie in My Will, what you cannot grasp now. However, when My disciple comes to you, who will lead you in all things, and consequently you become baptized in My Name through him, the Holy Ghost will come over you, and will instruct you in all things.
COR|0|5|18|0|With the criminal, you have done completely right. For you see, I do the same with you heathen. Nevertheless your deed is a good mirror, for what I already do and will do later in abundance.
COR|0|5|19|0|This is to your peace and your blessing! - Amen.
COR|0|6|1|1|Ten weeks later, King Abgarus wrote the sixth letter to the Lord.
COR|0|6|1|0|Abgarus, a small toparch in Edessa, to Jesus the good Saviour, all hail, Who appeared around Jerusalem, a blessing to all people that are of a good heart, and have the right will to arrange their life after His Word. -
COR|0|6|2|0|Oh Lord, forgive me for my great impertinence, and my already real bold approach toward You. But undoubtedly You know, that good physicians have always stood in the greatest esteem with mankind, because they always possessed a most sure knowledge in the things of nature, because with great appearances in nature anybody gladly turned to them, only to receive from them more or less apathetic information.
COR|0|6|3|0|How endlessly higher over all nature conversant physicians of the world are You in my eyes, You who are not only the Physician of all things, but You are also at the same time Creator and Lord of all nature from eternity!!! To You alone can I now convey my present strange national-crisis, and implore You out of the deepest depth of my heart to graciously prevent this strange suffering.
COR|0|6|4|0|You see, as You most certainly already know, ten days ago we sensed a little earthquake here, which, forever thanks to You, passed by without any particular traces. A couple of days after this earthquake all the water became cloudy, and every person who drank the water got headaches, and consequently became entirely confused!
COR|0|6|5|0|I immediately published a stern decree, that no one may utilize the water in my entire country, until I decree to make use of it again. In the meantime however, all my citizens should come to me to Edessa, where meanwhile they will be supplied with wine and water, which I have now specifically delivered for that purpose on large ships out of a rather remote Greek island.
COR|0|6|6|0|I believe, since pure love to my people and the truest pity over the same drove me to this action, not to have done a bad act. For that reason I beg You, oh Lord, in all humility and remorse in my heart, help my folk and me out of this crisis!
COR|0|6|7|0|For You see, the water does not want to clear itself, and the terrible effect is always the same. Oh Lord, I know that all good and evil powers and authorities are subject to You, and must yield to Your sign; therefore I plead to You, have most gracious pity on me, and because of the poor citizens free me of this plague. May Your divine Holy Will be done! -
COR|0|6|8|0|When the Lord had read this letter, he was deeply provoked in his inner most, and spoke aloud like a thunder: “Oh Satan, Satan! How long do you still want to try God, your Lord!? What did this poor good little kingdom do to you, you most wicked snake, that you would plaque it so abominably?
COR|0|6|9|0|On that you once again learn, that I am your Lord, and so it will be that there is an end with your malice in this country from this moment on. Amen.
COR|0|6|10|0|Have you not once only engaged in the flesh of mankind, to merely test it, what I allowed you, as with Job!? What are you doing with my earth!? - If you have courage, attack me! However my earth, and the people, who carry me in their hearts, leave in peace until the time, that I will grant you for the very last test of freedom!”
COR|0|6|11|1|Following this exclamation, He called a disciple to direct the following words to Abgarus that read therefore:
COR|0|6|11|0|My beloved son and brother Abgarus! This appalling blow has not your enemy, but alone My enemy played with you. You however, don’t know this enemy; I however, know him for a very, very long time.
COR|0|6|12|0|My enemy is the old invisible ruler of this world, and had until now great power not only on this earth, which is his house, but also in the stars. His power alone will only last a short time, and soon the prince of this world will be defeated. –
COR|0|6|13|0|You however have to never fear him again, since I have defeated him now for you and your people. Therefore you may now peacefully utilize the water in your country, because it became in this moment purely healthy.
COR|0|6|14|0|You see, whilst you loved Me, bad things happened to you; however, because your love to Me was more powerful in the oppression, so has your love won over all the power of hell, and you are now for always free from such hellish nativities!
COR|0|6|15|0|Therefore it will come to pass that the faith is sacrificed to great temptations, and will have to go through fire and water. But the fire of love will suffocate the test-fire of faith, and the water with its all-powerfulness will evaporate.
COR|0|6|16|0|However, like it has now naturally taken place in your country, so it will some day fare spiritually with many out of My teachings; they will also become very absurd, those that will drink out of the puddles of false prophets.
COR|0|6|17|0|My Love, My Blessing and My Grace to you, My brother, Abgarus, Amen.
COR|0|7|1|1|Seventh and last letter of the King Abgarus to the Lord Jesus, whom he wrote nine weeks after the response of the sixth answer to the Lord, and which arrived five days before the Lords entry into Jerusalem.
COR|0|7|1|0|Abgarus, a small toparch in Edessa, to Jesus, the good Saviour, all hail, Who appeared in the surrounding of Jerusalem, the Salvation to all mankind, the Lord and anointed King from eternity, the God of all creation, of all men and all gods, the good as well as the evil!
COR|0|7|2|0|Oh my God, oh You exclusive Fulfiller of my heart and fullest embodiment of all of my thoughts! I already know for sure out of Your first most gracious letter to me that all things must happen with You after Your own inconceivable advice, which presently the Semitic Jews in Jerusalem intend to do with You.
COR|0|7|3|0|I can also almost certainly darkly imagine, that all that must probably be so. But oh Lord, You will certainly yet better realize than I, a weak person who is observing it from my human side, that my to You now over all loving heart resist against this. The chain of events will show in the course of this my letter, that I have but full reason to report such to You, oh Lord.
COR|0|7|4|0|See, I as a Roman vassal, a close relative of Tiberius, who is emperor in Rome, also have in Jerusalem my loyal Roman observers, who have especially a sharp eye on the there extremely haughty priesthood. My observers exactly reported to me, what these proud, insolent priests and Pharisees intend to do with You.
COR|0|7|5|0|They want not only after their method, to stone or burn You; no, that is not enough for them, but they rather want to make an example on You of the most inhumane cruelty as a warning to others! – Listen, oh Lord! These beasts in human form want to hang and fasten You with sharp nails on the cross, and let You hang on them so long, until You slowly die at the pole of disgrace, because of the most excruciating pain, and they want to carry out this masterpiece of human malice in this soon coming Passover celebration!
COR|0|7|6|0|Lord may it be, as it will; but it has outraged me right into my innermost! Therefore, I know these purely sensual and tyrannical beasts do not quite want to kill You, because You give yourself out as their promised Messiah before the people. Oh that would worry this priestly mob of Hyenas less; for I know it only too well that they believe themselves neither in a God, even much less in You, and they care very little about blasphemy among themselves.
COR|0|7|7|0|But they have itself an entirely different plan! See, because of their secret conspiracies these beasts know that they are observed by Rome with all Argus-eyes. And the very keen-sighted Pilate has already in the previous year, as was planned, accurately seen through such a high-priestly attempted uprising, and has, as you well know, seized in the Outer Court five hundred poor, and also wealthy, mostly unfortunately Galileans, and had them at once beheaded, through which means he certainly drew the enmity of Herod against himself, because it has mostly affected his subjects.
COR|0|7|8|0|This example had a strong effect on the shattered minds of the Templar. In order to patch this nuisance up, they have now singled You out, and want to accuse You as a state-rebel before Pontus as the chief enemy of last years uprising, so that in this way they wash themselves clean before the Roman court, and turn Rome’s nuisance Argus-eyes from themselves, in order to easily forge once again more plans of high treason, however what in no case will succeed with them. You see it also without this my letter, and endlessly better that they, to a hair, are found out in Rome.
COR|0|7|9|0|If You, oh Lord, want a service of me, Your most ardent friend and adorer, I forward at once speedy messengers to Rome and to Pontus, and I stand with You, that these beasts at the same time will fall into the same pit, that they have prepared for You!
