FL|0|1|1|1|THE ORIGIN OF THE FLY. (March 8, 1842)
FL|0|1|1|0|The fly, a small animal indeed and often troublesome to man as well as other living creatures on earth, especially at that time of the year when the rays of the sun beat upon the ground, is not so insignificant in the order of things or so purposeless as it may seem to be.
FL|0|1|2|0|In order to examine all this completely and usefully, we must pre-examine the natural state of this little animal.
FL|0|1|3|0|It would be superfluous to show you the shape of the yet-to-be-discussed fly, of which you will surely have many, but we should not neglect her interesting details or her coming into existence, which should be observed with diligence and an attentive spirit.
FL|0|1|4|0|How and what is the origin of the fly?
FL|0|1|5|0|Scientists may know that the fly lays eggs which are so small that they can hardly be seen by the human eye, and are, therefore, so light that the eggs, like sun-dust, can stay in the air very easily.
FL|0|1|6|0|But where does the fly lay its little eggs, since their number often exceeds millions, and how and where are they raised? Have you ever seen a young fly? However, the gnats are not young flies.
FL|0|1|7|0|Understand, the fly, upon reaching maturity, lays her eggs wherever it sits down, and then it forgets about them. Millions are scattered by the wind into all regions of the earth, millions go into the water, yes, you probably cannot think of anything on earth, which remains free from its eggs. Since there is, so to speak, nothing so holy on which it might not land or which it may not sniff, therefore, other than glowing coals and a blazing fire, there is almost nothing, which the fly might not smear with its eggs.
FL|0|1|8|0|Where the fly lays her little eggs and how they appear we already know, but how they hatch and how many survive of the countless numbers that are laid, we shall understand at once.
FL|0|1|9|0|Most of these little eggs, which are laid on moist walls of houses or preferably in animal stalls or on rotting wood or some other moisture-holding mold, are safe, but the eggs blown away by the wind, of these only a very few hatch. Nevertheless, nothing is lost; instead it has another wise purpose, including those that are inhaled by man and beast, often amounting to millions, with just one breath. But let us leave those that are destined for another purpose and return to those that do hatch.
FL|0|1|10|0|How will these hatch?
FL|0|1|11|0|Please note, when the sun has warmed the earth sufficiently, these little eggs begin to grow until they are so big they can be seen by a reasonably sharp eye as a whitish-gray flower pollen. Naturally, they are seen only at the spots where they have been laid by the fly. This is the time of hatching which happens thus:
FL|0|1|12|0|The little eggs are compelled to break open by the awakened spirits of the pre-animals of the natural order congregated within the eggs. These spirits combine into a life in the form of a scarcely visible worm. This worm nourishes itself for a few days from the moisture available at the place where it was hatched. The period of nourishment is not determined exactly, but is determined by the quality and richness of the nourishment present.
FL|0|1|13|0|Up to this point, the reproduction process of the fly occurs in the normal way.
FL|0|1|14|0|However, I asked you at the outset whether or not you had ever seen a young fly. See, the actual miracle of the little fly is concealed in this. It is suddenly here and nobody knows where it came from or where it was born.
FL|0|1|15|0|Then, how does this miracle happen?
FL|0|1|16|0|Perhaps, on occasion, you have heard old people say, ‘”The flies come partly from dust and partly from the scattered parts of dead flies.” It appears to be thus but, of course, in reality it is not so.
FL|0|1|17|0|As soon as the worm has reached the proper size, which is approximately the size of a comma of a medium type script, the little worm bursts open and turns itself inside out. Then the former outer skin reforms, expands and stretches out to become the actual body of the fly, well provided with all the inner digestive organs; the former inside of the worm then brings forth the outer, visible parts of the fly, which, as soon as this transformation has occurred and comes into contact with the outside air, reach their final stage of development within a time frame of five to seven seconds maximum, at which time the fly is fully developed.
FL|0|1|18|0|Comprehend well, this is the birth or, rather, the most noteworthy coming into being of the fly, and to every observer this must appear as a sufficient miracle! Nevertheless, this is the least miraculous attribute of this little animal. What will follow soon will astonish you greatly and leave you in awe! - so let us continue this noteworthy subject another day.
FL|0|2|1|1|Chapter 2
FL|0|2|1|1|THE FEET OF THE FLY. (March 11, 1842)
FL|0|2|1|0|It will not have escaped your notice, and you will have seen quite often how the fly, with its six little feet, patters forth so agilely on a highly polished vertical surface as well as on a horizontal table or plane.
FL|0|2|2|0|But how is this possible for this animal, since its feet, although each one terminates with two very small pointed claws, are still smooth on the outside?
FL|0|2|3|0|See, that is already something miraculous, considering that on a vertically standing, highly polished surface, not even the lightest down feather can remain hanging without being glued on! How is it possible for the fly without some means of sticking?
FL|0|2|4|0|Some very active natural scientists have found, with the aid of very powerful magnifying devices, that the fly – and all animals of this kind – have a very elastic little bell attached to its feet between the claws, which it uses as tiny vacuums to thin the air, accomplished in the following manner: when a fly places a foot on the upright surface of a window pane, she sucks in the air inside of a bell, thus the foot, provided with the vacuum of the little bell, is held fast to the surface by the weight of the outer air surrounding the little bell.
FL|0|2|5|0|To accomplish this task, each fly would have to have its own internal air pump! And how fast it would have to operate such an inexpressibly clever mechanical device to satisfy the demands of all six feet in the quick and unpredictable meanderings of the fly?!
FL|0|2|6|0|Obviously, this is hardly feasible, although the fly does in fact possess such visible little bells! But, if the fly does not hold itself in the manner diagnosed by the natural scientists, how does it accomplish this task” – the answer will be very easily perceived from the following presentation.
FL|0|2|7|0|If you have ever, even once, observed a fly very closely, you must have noticed that it is provided with tiny hairs and bristle-like points all over its body. Yes, even the pair of wings on their outermost rim are provided with a large quantity of outward-running ray-like pointed little feathers.
FL|0|2|8|0|What use is all this to the fly? Soon we will have the answer.
FL|0|2|9|0|These little hairs and bristle-like points are all useful electricity vacuums, and the electricity sucked into the fly streams toward the negative pole, which is simultaneously serving as the attracting or drawing- together pole, which then flows into the already well-known little bells in the feet of the fly. Being negative, it becomes very hungry for the positive electricity.
FL|0|2|10|0|See, this then is the answer to the previous question.
FL|0|2|11|0|But then you will say, “That occurs quite naturally. Therefore, how is it a miracle?” To which I can give you no other answer than this: The more natural a matter appears to you, it is that much more a miracle because it is not something transitory and thus of little use, but permanent and therefore a constant and beneficial miracle for all times to him who wants to observe it in My name! For you need only to meditate a little and think a bit and it must become clear to you which of the following is more of a miracle – the Israelites crossing the Red Sea or the existence of a fruit-bearing tree, which still brings forth the same fruit as it did at the time of Adam, or our fly, which is still the same today as it was millions of years before Adam! Now, judge for yourselves which miracle is greater or more important!
FL|0|2|12|0|If the fly is called a miracle, yes, a great miracle by Me, by virtue of its unusual development as well as its continued survival and the usefulness of all its life-bearing parts, and due to its other, as yet unknown purpose, is proclaimed by Me as wonderful, yes, an extremely wonderful being, then the walking of the fly on a polished surface can be called a miracle with more right – since this can be observed by everyone daily, should a person give this occurrence any importance at all – than the collapse of the walls of Jericho by Joshua’s trumpets.
FL|0|2|13|0|The fly walking on a vertical polished surface occurs countless times every day before your eyes, while concerning the collapse of the walls of Jericho, other than being recorded in the Scriptures, there is no trace of it in the whole world. Therefore, whosoever wants to make some use of the miraculous collapse of the walls of Jericho, will have to believe strongly that it happened at all, whereas on a summer’s day he is afflicted by more than a thousand miracles of the first kind, which often calls to him annoyingly, “See here, you proud and arrogant man, how richly the Great Holy Creator has surrounded you with living miracles, from which you should learn and acknowledge within you how close to you the Lord of Life is!”
FL|0|2|14|0|Therefore, judge for yourselves which of the miracles is greater and more important in relation to you! To a heart full of loving understanding, I think a fly buzzing in your ear, a cricket chirping, a twittering sparrow and a modest (spring) violet do not sing a less an uplifting high song in praise to Me than Solomon in all his wisdom and kingly majesty!
FL|0|2|15|0|The wisdom of Solomon is great wisdom to those who themselves are into the wisdom of Solomon, but in the song of the living, as well as the silent, nature, lie greater, as well as endlessly deeper, things than in all the wisdom of the son of David!
FL|0|2|16|0|And so the fly tells you, with its so wonderfully rapid flight, what holy power sets its light wings into quick motion and with these wings carries the wonder animal happily in all directions, here and there, up and down, and tells you constantly as well, “If the Holy Father does such great miracles on me, a small despised animal, what will He do with you, His children?!
FL|0|2|17|0|Isn’t this wisdom above wisdom and miracle above miracle?!
FL|0|2|18|0|The final part of this communication will reveal to you this miracle fully; therefore, let the good and true be enough for today!
FL|0|3|1|1|Chapter 3
FL|0|3|1|1|THE FLY AS AIR ELECTRICITY BALANCER. (March 15, 1842)
FL|0|3|1|0|What we have learned so far about the fly is certainly wonderful, yes, more than wonderful, but one of the greater miracles is contained in its purpose and the way in which it corresponds to its purpose.
FL|0|3|2|0|How manifold is this purpose? Can it be simple? And if it is, how simple would that be? Can it be manifold?
FL|0|3|3|0|In the entire creation there is nothing that has more than two polarities, namely a positive and a negative polarity. Therefore, there is only a below and an above, an outer and an inner, a material and a spiritual, a good and an evil, a true and a false.
FL|0|3|4|0|Thus, if we talk about the reason for an entity’s being, it can only be within the confines of these two polarities. And so let us see for what purposes the fly is useful.
FL|0|3|5|0|Let us consider the outer pole.
FL|0|3|6|0|You must be aware of how very few of these animals there are in the wintertime, whereas in the summer all is buzzing and teeming with these little air inhabitants.
FL|0|3|7|0|See, My dear children, we will presently introduce another miracle from our little animal.
FL|0|3|8|0|We have already seen, with the discovery of the first miracle in which I explained to you its ability to walk, why the fly is so full of little hairs and bristles. But this is not the only reason for the fly being so hairy and bristly. You will soon learn why each of these little animals has been provided with a pair of wings.
FL|0|3|9|0|Understand that this animal, through the sucking in of the electrical stuff (in the manner already explained) becomes so weightless against the earth’s gravity that it can be carried about in the air by its little wings in all directions!
FL|0|3|10|0|Why is it carried about thus, or why, the warmer it is, must it fly, here and there, faster? Pay close attention and we shall soon see!
FL|0|3|11|0|See, these millions and millions of flies have the purpose of consuming the excessive so-called electrical fire generated by the sun, thus lessening its effect, so that it does not unleash itself through overloading and delivering a finishing blow to the entire world. Understand, this electrical fluid is an extremely mighty fire – this, of course, means ‘in its positive sphere’! As long as the planet’s negative electricity is in balance with the positive, which develops from the sun’s rays, no unleashing of the positive electricity is possible. But if the positive electricity exceeds the negative even by a thousandth part, the unleashing of the positive is almost unavoidable. How then is such devastation prevented?
FL|0|3|12|0|Now, watch our little animals, how they flit here and there so industriously and, in their rapid flight, suck up the excess positive electricity, wherein the polarity is soon reversed; the fly uses up the positive, which resembles oxygen, and then breathes out the negative, as man does with nitrogen from the inhaled air after the lungs have retained the oxygen for the nourishment of the blood.
FL|0|3|13|0|However, you might ask Me, “Are these little animals really capable of all this?”
FL|0|3|14|0|And I say to you: Oh yes, My dear ones! A single fly reverses so much positive electricity in one summer’s day that, if it was collected in a container, there would be enough energy to turn a mountain ten times larger than your Schlossberg into dust in a second, - so with the quantity of air a person inhales and exhales. If kindled, it could destroy all of Europe, totally changing its appearance, so that nobody would recognize it as it was before or as it is now, a well-populated and fruitful land.
FL|0|3|15|0|So that this does not sound too fantastic to you, I will draw your attention to the insignificant cause (i.e. in the natural sense) of the large earthquake that was felt over almost an entire hemisphere and beyond. See, this was caused by thousands of cubic feet of trapped air which was kindled through outside pressure.
FL|0|3|16|0|Now, let us assume that a person with four breaths consumes, or rather, reverses and exchanges one cubic foot of air. Think how often a person inhales throughout the day, and you will be amazed at the amount of air just one man consumes, or rather exchanges in the course of a day – or to be more correct – in a 24 hour period. If you consider this in the light of the above, it should not sound too fantastic when I present to you the possibility of the destruction of Europe through the quantity of one person’s daily breath.
FL|0|3|17|0|Therefore, what I said before about the amount of electricity a fly converts in one day should not sound too fantastic. And if one fly can accomplish so much, think how much more millions and millions can accomplish.
FL|0|3|18|0|Now, My dear little children, isn’t it a miracle when I protect the world from sudden destruction with such an insignificant little worker?!
FL|0|3|19|0|But all of this is just a small secondary purpose of this little animal and, therefore, not the greatest of miracles. But be patient, the main point is coming soon – and so let us leave it again for today.
FL|0|4|1|1|Chapter 4
FL|0|4|1|1|THE FLY AS LIFEGUARD TO MAN. (March 16, 1842)
FL|0|4|1|0|We have learned this little animal’s one purpose for the negative pole, but that is not the only purpose for that pole. There are still a number of secondary purposes arranged as a householder arranges tasks for his servants, in that secondary tasks are used in addition to the primary task, so that his movements and time are fully occupied. Therefore, before we proceed to another of the main tasks of this little animal, let us acquaint ourselves with a few more of his secondary tasks.
FL|0|4|2|0|As you know, My dear little ones, in the summer it can be quite troublesome to you when there are so many flies in the room bothering you, especially when they are quite persistent. For this action, none of you should scold this little animal, for on just such a day it performs a very important little secondary task, indeed a most useful task to man and domestic animals. You would like to know what this secondary task consists of! Be patient, first a little remembrance – then we will have the answer.
FL|0|4|3|0|Understand, My dear little children, on such a very warm summer’s day, especially when the barometer is very low, countless milliards and milliards of little atomic animals are born out of the low lying ether into the atmospheric air, which is the reason why you often see the air a dense blue, so dense that it is difficult to see areas only a few hours distant.
FL|0|4|4|0|If you then take a breath, several trillion of these little atomic animals take the opportunity to march into you. Even though they are so small that you would not even notice billions of them in a heap, the several decillions, which a man sometimes inhales during such a day, do amount to something quite significant, and – since these life forms are quite dangerous to the human body – could be enough to take a man’s natural life. The dangerous nature of these little animals to the human body is close to that which is commonly called prussic acid.
FL|0|4|5|0|Now we understand this, but we still don’t know what that has to do with our fly. This is one of the previously mentioned little secondary tasks of the fly, which we will get to right after the following explanations.
FL|0|4|6|0|You see, that portion of the ‘atomic creatures’ that a person inhales is not the most dangerous to his health, because the oxygen-poor blood, i.e. oxygen poor due to the atmospheric conditions, readily and beneficially absorbs that part. It is quite a different matter with those that settle themselves on the outer skin, and especially at those places where the pores of the skin are mostly open.
FL|0|4|7|0|When these animalcules enter the pores, in contrast to the ones inhaled, they take on a positive character as long as the outer pole is in balance with the inner pole, as it is in moderate temperatures, there is no danger, but if the outer pole exceeds the inner pole only by one part in a million, then there is already a great danger to man’s life, since there could develop a pole reversal in him, which would be as beneficial as if someone stuck himself with a needle freshly dipped in prussic acid.
FL|0|4|8|0|If the outer pole would suddenly over-balance the inner, negative pole, by one part in a hundred, then there could occur a visible electrical discharge, which would, in a few moments, turn his body into a handful of foul-smelling ashes.
FL|0|4|9|0|In the first case, look to the plagues; these are nothing but such consequences. The second instance, referred to as spontaneous combustion does not happen very often, but is not completely unknown or unheard of, especially in the more southern lands.
FL|0|4|10|0|Now that we know this, let us look to our little household helpers and observe them at their work.
FL|0|4|11|0|See, our little fly has a pair of eyes, which, for this creature, are so large that they make up nearly one seventh of his body! Each eye is not only a single eye, but is made up of more than a thousand tiny eyes. These tiny eyes are aligned as orderly as the cells of a honeycomb, each one pointed, like a cone, towards a single focal point and, in this way, serve the creature as, what you would call, an indescribably strong microscope with which the fly can see every single one of those previously mentioned atomic creatures.
FL|0|4|12|0|Furthermore, the fly’s stomach is so arranged that these creatures are its primary food source. When a fly notices a large cluster of these animacule on a person’s skin, it flies to the food source and isn’t easily distracted until it has consumed its entire find.
FL|0|4|13|0|Besides the eyes, this animal also has a pair of little feelers, which serve in place of a nose. Since it can use its eyes for only short distances, these feelers often serve the fly for very long distances. Yes, I tell you, there are some flies that can smell, with these feelers, a good-tasting nourishment that is miles away.
FL|0|4|14|0|No, My dear little children, here again we have one of the miracles of this little animal or, as previously mentioned, a secondary purpose of its being!
FL|0|4|15|0|Isn’t this quite a useful service by this little animal?! Yes, I tell you, - and mark this well! – If at any place, especially in the summer time, this little creature suddenly disappears; you can take that as a certain sign that My chastening rod is not too far away.
FL|0|4|16|0|As we reveal this secondary service, there are still other, more beneficial, services that this little creature performs.
FL|0|4|17|0|If you wanted to learn all of the services, I would have to dictate to you for several years. And, of this one thing, you can be sure - everything that exists, including the fly, is there not for one, but for a thousand good purposes.
FL|0|4|18|0|To refrain from stretching this out too long, and before we change over to the creature’s positive pole, I want to disclose two more similarly useful secondary purposes in support of this, My revelation, - and so let us again leave it for today.
FL|0|5|1|1|Chapter 5
FL|0|5|1|1|THE FLY AS A WHOLESOME AIR PRESERVER. (March 17, 1842)
FL|0|5|1|0|On a hot summer’s day, especially on a humid afternoon, you will often have experienced how sleep tries to overpower a tired person. A young person can fight it off by different means, such a physical exercise, or some interesting activity, to keep him awake.
FL|0|5|2|0|It is another matter with a much older person, whose limbs have been through a lot and have become stiffer, more painful and a lot sleepier. On such a day, if the air around him lacks the vital life substance for his needs, then comes the above-mentioned sleepiness, and such a person may not be able to stay awake. For you to grasp the negative effects of such sleep, it is necessary to take a look at man’s natural sleep first.
FL|0|5|3|0|Why does a person naturally get sleepy at night and not in the daytime? Indeed, the cause is quite natural; but since most people have not recognized the area of influence of the natural sphere, the cause of natural sleep is mostly unknown to them.
FL|0|5|4|0|Understand, when the light of the sun, as the positive polar part of natural life, no longer spends its rays on one or the other side of the earth, the polarity on earth keeps changing, thus, as the sun sets for a region, that region immediately begins to change to a negative polarity.
FL|0|5|5|0|The negative pole of life corresponds to that of the earth. As this negative polarity actually resists the natural life activity, correspondingly in man, it consumes more and more of the positive electricity in man, thus man loses more and more of his outer activity, wherein the softer, movable parts, e.g. the eyelids, notice the loss first, and can no longer hold themselves upright and soon thereafter all other body parts follow into the same weakened state, this then is man’s natural nighttime sleep.
FL|0|5|6|0|Now, the only question that remains is how the natural sleep differs from the aforementioned daytime sleep. Once this is understood, we will have the entire subject.
FL|0|5|7|0|Daytime sleep is the very opposite of the natural sleep, since it is not caused by the decrease of positive electricity, but by over-saturation with it. A less active body is no longer able to use up, or rather exchange, the ingested positive electricity into the proper amount of negative electricity.
FL|0|5|8|0|When the positive begins to outweigh the negative, the negative begins to decrease in the same proportion. The result of this is easy to understand.
FL|0|5|9|0|As two men of unequal strength wrestle with one another, the weaker the weak one becomes, the more power the strong one has over him. But once the weak one is fully overcome, the strength of the strong one has come to an end, because there is nothing more to resist his superior strength. Every power is as good as no power at all if there is no resistance, nothing to support or utilize the power.
FL|0|5|10|0|See, My darlings, so it is with a person when he is overcome by sleep in the DAYTIME, and – mark well – on a humid, summer’s day saturated with electricity. But what have our flies to do with all this?!
FL|0|5|11|0|Notice, here will be revealed another important and greatly useful and, one of the two already promised, secondary purposes of this little animal.
FL|0|5|12|0|These little animals whirr and buzz and patter diligently over such a daytime sleeper and through their feet and their various hairs and bristles suck up the excess positive electricity, so that, regardless of the superabundance, the positive electricity does not suppress the sleeper’s negative electricity, thus preserving the natural life of the sleeper.
FL|0|5|13|0|If there were no such insignificant regulators of this natural life’s substance, diligently maintaining the balance as much as possible, there would be an end to that natural life the moment the positive electricity completely overcame the negative electricity. (See 4.8 preceding)
FL|0|5|14|0|The sleeper drives these pesky creatures away as long as he can – but that does not mean anything, for as long as he can still ward them off, there is no danger to his life. Once sleep has him totally paralyzed, these bothersome creatures have a free hand and they make sure nothing endangers the life of the sleeper. When, in time, and sometimes only through the efforts of these little pests, the negative polarity becomes more and more balanced, the sleeper awakens and chases these little life-savers from his body. And this is all right since, once he is awake, the danger of losing his natural life is as good as over.
FL|0|5|15|0|Now, My dear little ones, how do you like the secondary duty of this little animal? You must admit that all this is arranged exceedingly well and wisely by Me, to which I add: Eventually, when you have a spiritual overview of the total purpose of this animal, only then will you be able to really wonder and say, “How great and good You are, oh Holy Father, when You have already placed, in such a seemingly insignificant creation, such unfathomably wise purposes! Who can praise and extol You enough even for one fly?! Where will we ever get the words, thoughts and feelings to appreciate and feel and most gratefully acknowledge Your Majesty, Your endless Love and Wisdom in one of Your more complete (i.e. perfect) creations?!
FL|0|5|16|0|Yes, My dear little children, there are more things considerably greater in a sun than in a fly. But whoever wants to recognize Me must first go to the small school, and begin to recognize the Dear Father there! Once he has persevered there, later he will surely persevere in the larger one and will rejoice beyond measure when he recognizes there that the same loving Holy Father, who Himself guides and leads suns through immeasurable paths, and writes laws of eternal Love for the most majestic, the most mighty and the most complete spirits.
FL|0|5|17|0|See, My dear ones, you will eventually fully recognize all this, and so let us return again to the narrow and, until now, totally unrecognized sphere of activity, which means: let us return again to our little fly and observe one more of its beneficial secondary purposes.
FL|0|6|1|1|Chapter 6
FL|0|6|1|1|THE FLY AS CHEMIST AND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTOR (March 18, 1842)
FL|0|6|1|0|Often you will have noticed that flies gladly set themselves in a place where there is something on which they can nibble, therefore they are often found in great numbers, as uninvited guests at mealtime, and go at the food with great voracity. Also you will have noticed that these guests are more numerous when the day is exceptionally sultry and the meals are served in rooms, which have a low ceiling and are musty smelling.
FL|0|6|2|0|Again, there arises a question, and many may ask, “Yes, should we then praise these little parasites when they soil our food and often become unbearable with every bite we put into our mouths?”
FL|0|6|3|0|However, I say to you: the shortsighted man so asks, judges and becomes irate! But, if he could see and fully understand the service the fly performs for him, when it lights only for two seconds on a bite or on a spoon on the way to his mouth, - really, he would not be overdoing it if he had the fly gold-plated!
FL|0|6|4|0|Notice then, on a really sultry day, all foods, with very few exceptions, have the property, due to their sugar content, of attracting all the nitrogen from the air! If the food is then left standing, even for a short time, this bad air makes its presence known. Firstly, the food sours easily, some become moldy, some alter their color and some, where the food is not so thick, get a dull blue appearance around the edges, - see, these are all effects of the spoiled air!
FL|0|6|5|0|Yes, but what does the fly do there? – Well, since the fly, as we have learned, is a little flying electric flask, it is also hungry and eager for everything belonging to its natural sphere.
FL|0|6|6|0|The corrupted air consists of negative electricity and repulses the positive electricity, often to such an extent, that there isn’t a spark of positive electricity left in the room, or rather in the food consumed therein.
FL|0|6|7|0|Everyone may ask of himself: Quite often, if none of these vessels of electricity were found in such a room, how would it affect the health of a human body?! But that is of the least importance, for as long as the corrupt air occupies the entire room, it has enough elasticity to expand the lungs when it is inhaled. However, once this air has lost its elasticity, it descends as musty dew upon its kind which, in this instance, is the negative food. Then, when someone begins to take a bite of the food which has been covered many times by the musty dew, one or more of the flies gladly set on it and allow the excess positive electricity to fall upon the object over which they crawl, i.e. the morsel of food.
FL|0|6|8|0|Now, what is the result of this act? I answer, - nothing more and nothing less than this. The descended foul air is quickly reanimated and rises, leaving the food harmless again and suitable for consumption. Whereas, if these little, bothersome chemists were not present on such a sultry day, especially in such a low-ceilinged, musty-smelling room, a person would seldom live past the mealtime.
FL|0|6|9|0|Now, how do you like this secondary service? Isn’t it something wonderful, and it is still as effective today as it was in ancient times?!
FL|0|6|10|0|Perhaps you may think and reply, “Now, that is too extraordinary! Should a fly have that wide a sphere of action?!”
FL|0|6|11|0|Thus, I say to you: Not only one such sphere of activity, of which you know only a tiny part, but this unpretentious, little creation has so great a sphere of activity that, to your understanding, it is almost endless. For, if I were to explain everything about this little animal to you, a hundred thousand scribes, working night and day without pause, would not finish the task in a million years.
FL|0|6|12|0|Therefore, do not marvel too much over these few points, which I have revealed to you! Whoever wants to go in the right direction, let him consider this, that with Me every, ever-so-seemingly insignificant, thing has an endless worth!
FL|0|6|13|0|Such thinking will be beneficial for everyone since, for example, they will keep a person in a constant state of humility, and, on the other hand, they will illustrate the standing of a truly righteous man, who is surely more important than a trillion flies.
FL|0|6|14|0|Since we are on the subject of flies, we will not measure a man’s worth here, but will pay a little more attention to the discussed secondary purposes of the fly!
FL|0|6|15|0|You might have also noticed that these satiated flies like to fly onto shining objects and, quite often, get them dirty all over. My dear children, you might ask yourselves, “Should that too be something useful?!”
FL|0|6|16|0|Oh yes, I tell you, this is something very useful, and without this activity the previously discussed chemical work of this animal would be only half done, if the second, insignificant activity did not soon follow.
FL|0|6|17|0|We have already learned that the fly takes mostly electrical negative nourishment and so is a true poison-sucker from the air that men and animals breathe, as well as from the foods men eat.
FL|0|6|18|0|Therefore, its refuse, if no longer harmful and poisonous, can only be electrically negative. We also know that the positive electricity collects mostly on polished objects, - see, now we will soon have it. Thus, in a room with very little positive electricity, what there is will surround the polished objects. The positive electricity, being properly distributed, the little chemists smear these shiny objects diligently, so that they, more and more, lose their strength to attract the positive electricity, which is necessary and indispensable for the air in the room. Should you find this difficult to believe, place a gilded object in such a room and you can be assured that, in a short time, it will be so smeared by these chemists that you will hardly see any gold glittering through.
FL|0|6|19|0|Yes, but why do these animals have such a passion for gold?
FL|0|6|20|0|To that I reply: Why do you gild your lighting rods?
FL|0|6|21|0|Your answer must be, “Because gold very strongly attracts electricity!” Then you will say, “But the flies also soil window panes and glass is not known to attract electricity!”
FL|0|6|22|0|That is, indeed, true but, on the other hand, I ask you, “Why are panes of glass or glass cylinders used to make the electricity, which is free in the air, visible by lightly rubbing them?”
FL|0|6|23|0|See, now I have caught you again and answer as follows, “Because the electricity likes to collect on the glass and, when the glass is rubbed a little, the electricity becomes visible.”
FL|0|6|24|0|Now that we know this, we can let our little chemists soil to their hearts’ content, thus the surface of these electricity holders get rougher and less capable of holding the positive electricity which is then forced to mingle properly with the air in the room.
FL|0|6|25|0|How do you respond to this, as you review these statements with a little attention?
FL|0|6|26|0|Now, what answer should one give to a person, who with his high reasoning power, disclaims the purpose of man? – Oh, what wicked foolishness!
FL|0|6|27|0|If I arrange it so that even the smallest and most insignificant creation has a very important purpose, and prescribe the fly a usefulness in all its seemingly insignificant functions, - how much more would I provide for man, who is not only My creation, but truly a CHILD OF MY LOVE, or at least should become one, which means that he should recognize that I am a Father to him, not simply a Creator, as I am to the stones and clumps of earth.
FL|0|6|28|0|Yes, even a marginally devout childlike heart has to say that I give Fatherly care to the silent grass in the field, - and such is true, yes, very true, for only the Father gives food and drink to all things whatever food and drink they may require. But, if I give Fatherly care to the dumb things in this manner, how much more Fatherly care will I give to those beings who came forth as CHILDREN OF MY LOVE, truly in MY IMAGE?!
FL|0|6|29|0|Mark this well! It is surely worth the effort to observe My Fatherly care in all minute things, so that it might become clear to the doubter, that I am not an all-consuming, unfathomable Powergod, but am solely and alone a true Father to all My dear children and that I am not a wasteful Father, but an exceedingly economical One, who even puts the dung of the fly to the best use for His children.
FL|0|6|30|0|Yes, I tell you, there are still countless other and more insignificant things, and still I don’t let even the minutest thing perish! And since I am, therefore, not the all-consuming God, but a Father preserving the smallest things, and also an exceedingly faithful economist for My children, - how great must be the blindness of a man who wants to contest My constant, all-encompassing Fatherly care for My children?!
FL|0|6|31|0|Oh, My dear children! Do believe Me! I am occupied day and night caring even for the growth of every hair on your body, which will soon perish together with your body; then how much more will I care for your immortal souls and your eternal spirit out of Me?!
FL|0|6|32|0|Yes, yes, My dear ones! Just observe these little flies; they really sing to you of victory, which you will come to recognize, more and more, in the following positive polarity presentation!
FL|0|6|33|0|Thus, let us leave it at that for today!
FL|0|7|1|1|Chapter 7
FL|0|7|1|1|THE FLY, - A COLLECTION POINT FOR THE LIFE FROM GOD. (March 19, 1842)
FL|0|7|1|0|Finally, after we have become familiar with the negative polarity aspect of the animal, which is actually the material side, we will turn to the positive polarity side and give special attention to the main miracle of the little animal.
FL|0|7|2|0|Whoever has seen a fly can hardly deny that the fly is alive, and rather will have to conclude, “This animal is not only alive but, as far as its life is concerned in the natural sense, it has more life than many other animals that are already on a much higher level of evolution.” Yes, and finally he will state, “Truly, if I could keep my other abilities, I’d be the first to change places with the lazy life of the fly.”
FL|0|7|3|0|Thus, if man must give such testimony to an animal, no other proof is needed to prove that the fly is, indeed, completely alive.
FL|0|7|4|0|The fly lives, this we already know, but how and why does it live, that, My dear little ones, is another question! For you to gain as much basic understanding as possible of this, it will be necessary to look at life itself first.
FL|0|7|5|0|So read carefully: The freest life is only in Me, but this life is so constituted and is of such overwhelming perfection that, in its sphere, it can never be comprehended by any created being. Therefore, it is a holy life and, because it is a holy life, it is also an eternal and everlasting life.
FL|0|7|6|0|Think of infinity as an area with a central point from which endless rays stream in all possible directions; the beginning of each ray is the central point, but the end is nowhere to be found.
FL|0|7|7|0|Within this center, all the living power of infinity is united, and from this center proceeds into infinity. To prevent this living power from being dispersed too much so that it could become weaker within itself, it has created, throughout infinity, an endless number of life collection points for itself, in which life is intercepted then returned to its original center.
FL|0|7|8|0|With this, My dear little ones, I have disclosed to you a very great secret! Yes, I tell you, a secret, which, as long as the earth has been inhabited by people, was known only to a few and then only vaguely hinted at.
FL|0|7|9|0|As you understand this secret a little, the question will automatically arise, “Yes, but why does this have to happen? In His life, could God truly ever become weaker?”
FL|0|7|10|0|I reply: Becoming weaker is quite impossible, provided God wants to remain alone and doesn’t want to create or form anything in or out of Himself.
FL|0|7|11|0|But if, following the need of His endless Love, He has created, for your comprehension and for many eternities, beings of such manifold variety, - from the most perfect spirit down to the most unimportant atomic animal, and has given life to all these endless beings, to each its own kind – now, tell Me, with what life did the Creator animate all these countless beings, sustains them still, and will sustain them in eternity?
FL|0|7|12|0|Would there be a private life somewhere with which He animates all these beings without having to animate them from His own life? I feel that even a stone would not reach such a conclusion. Since the Creator has no such private life, it is clear that He animates all these created beings out of Himself.
FL|0|7|13|0|Understandably, if all these creations, with their sustaining life, would move endlessly farther away from the center, the Central Power would, quite naturally, be lessened. Although the Life as such could never be lost, since it is an endless Life, it could become weaker, instead of always becoming stronger, because it would be subject to endless division.
FL|0|7|14|0|So that you may understand this weakening of power more fully, consider the endless divisibility of matter itself, since one can still imagine endlessly more divisions in a single atom. But, does the atom become stronger or just the opposite with the never-ending division? Although one cannot obliterate the atom through continuous division, you must understand that the endlessly divided atom will no longer have the power it had prior to the division.
FL|0|7|15|0|If you comprehend this even partially, another statement will follow, “Yes, if this is so, the Creator would have been better off had He not created anything at all!”
FL|0|7|16|0|Instead of replying to you, I will ask something well known to many people.
FL|0|7|17|0|Why do people who, from an early age, work hard – usually, or at least naturally – become stronger? That is question number one.
FL|0|7|18|0|Question number two: Why does one gradually attach more weight to a horseshoe magnet?
FL|0|7|19|0|Question number three: How does a person become an artist and a virtuoso?
FL|0|7|20|0|Do you see the light yet from these meaningful questions?
FL|0|7|21|0|Why does hammered metal become stronger and has much greater elasticity compared to that which has not been hammered?
FL|0|7|22|0|Why is it that, the more storms a tree has withstood, the harder and more durable is its wood?
FL|0|7|23|0|Understand and mark it well: why have there been so many stopping points of life established in infinity! Now, read and comprehend: So that the original eternal life can exercise itself more and more and, accordingly, increase its endless power! Because of this, the Life that emanates from the center returns to the center more perfect and more intensive than when it departed.
FL|0|7|24|0|Once this concept is completely understood, My darlings, the first two questions, of “how” and “why” the fly lives, will have been as good as answered. As for “how” it lives, the answer is contained within itself, in that it is an established ‘point of collection’ for the life coming forth from the center, thus it collects and takes up the life from a large number of previous animals.
FL|0|7|25|0|Thus the answer to the first question must already be evident to a blind man.
FL|0|7|26|0|Now, it surely won’t be difficult for anyone to determine in advance “why” it lives, namely: So that the total of its life makes the transition, returns again as a more complete, more intensive life, proceeding onwards and upwards to the soul of man, which is then capable of receiving the most intensive life from Me, which – as you know – can now fully unite with Me again into “one” power through Love!
FL|0|7|27|0|Now, when you consider our little animal from this standpoint and do not cry out, “The fly, the fly, it sings to us of victory!” then you must be stricken with three-fold blindness and deafness.
FL|0|7|28|0|But that which has been said about the animal’s positive polarity should only serve as a useful introduction, so that you will better understand that which is still to follow. Consider it well, the following presentation will let you see in more detail the nature of this animal – and so with that, let us leave it again for today.
FL|0|8|1|1|Chapter 8
FL|0|8|1|1|THE FLY AND THE BIRTH OF COMETS. (March 20, 1842)
FL|0|8|1|0|For you to understand the following important matter thoroughly, it will be necessary to review that which has already been told; that is, only the positive polarity part of our fly, since that is the part which is the collection point of life.
FL|0|8|2|0|Take a close look at the sun. Which of you can make a good estimate of how far its most distant rays reach? It will certainly not be an insignificant distance. If you put the sun’s age at over a hundred thousand decillion years, the unthinkably long time during which it has been sending its rays into the endless spaces, and the first, the original rays are still on their rapid journey into the vast endlessness, while countless more rays have been reflected and returned, you will more firmly and fundamentally understand what has already been said about the collection points of life, as the sunshine cries out to you daily, “See, I have sent my rays into endless space all this time, and still my light is no weaker for you than it was endlessly long times before!”
FL|0|8|3|0|But here, you will easily ask, “How then, will the sun get those rays back, which are still in the process of going out into the endless distances of space, rays from the first evolutionary period of the sun?”
FL|0|8|4|0|And I say to you that this doesn’t hurt anything; for if the rays would still proceed a decillion times further than they already have, they would still encounter a point which would impede their progress and cause them to return.
FL|0|8|5|0|“But,” you might say, “how does the sunlight get replaced after the long journey of relatively few stopping points; the returning light must be, at most, very sparse?”
FL|0|8|6|0|But this also does not hurt anything. The sun receives back its own rays only very sparsely; it is, on the other hand, also a collection point, and as such takes up rays from more than a milliard other suns, intensifies these, and then radiates them out again in large quantities.
FL|0|8|7|0|Now, if you consider this a little, you will very easily find, at your fingertips, how light, formed by Me from endlessness to endlessness, is managed and arranged, and in this way not even the smallest atom floats without purpose in the infinite ether of endlessness.
FL|0|8|8|0|For the spirit unaccustomed to thinking of great things, such a concept is difficult to grasp, but a creative example which I want to include here for you, will surely serve your spirit well in understanding the return and economical exchange of rays.
FL|0|8|9|0|And now, understand: Wherever the rays of two suns meet in the – for your comprehension – plainly very wide in-between spaces, there they themselves eventually turn into a mutual reception point.
FL|0|8|10|0|Already you ask, “How then, and in what way?”
FL|0|8|11|0|This question is really very easy to understand and answer, as you surely have to accept that the outgoing ray, which is contained in time and space – even though it is undeniably subtle – is certainly something material nevertheless.
FL|0|8|12|0|When such rays of two suns meet, they are naturally, as rays of a sun, of the same polarity. But you know that things of like polarity never attract but always repel one another. Now, if you possess just a little bit of good understanding in your heart, you must be able to grasp as already stated, that when such rays meet they repel each other and – as you tend to say – send each other home.
FL|0|8|13|0|But what happens when the rays of several suns must necessarily, and in a quite natural way, meet each other in a place, which is equally distant from all of these suns, and the rays meet each other from all possible directions.
FL|0|8|14|0|Now that is a slightly different question. But in order not to keep you from the main point for too long, I will tell you now that which you would have learned through diligent thought; that at this spot a conflict builds up between rays, because some of the rays cut right through some of the other rays and meet there, - which transversing of the rays you must view as if you laid several crosses upon one another, so that a number of rays running out from a middle point would be visible.
FL|0|8|15|0|These transversing rays necessarily neutralize the polarity, and by that they hinder other rays, which run into the diagonal, from immediately making their return trip. Accordingly, in time, there develops a ball of rays or, better for your understanding, a shimmering ball of light which, with time, develops a kind of mist-fine thickness and so becomes heavier and heavier.
FL|0|8|16|0|Now, since suns, like the planets, move around other central suns, it depends which sun, rotating along its wide path, comes close to this ball of light, with the consequence that it then quite naturally draws this ball into its sphere and thus consumes it.
FL|0|8|17|0|Now that you know this, I tell you that this is the proper, most true formation of comets.
FL|0|8|18|0|But I already perceive another question in your mind, which is, “Yes, but how come such comets survive, and aren’t consumed by these suns which attracted them?”
FL|0|8|19|0|You could, indeed, deduce the answer from that which has been said previously, but in order to save you from so much thinking, I will tell you that the reason lies in the already mentioned neutralization of the rays. By that neutralizing or – for your better comprehension – relaxation, the assembled rays become negative in polarity, and so form in relationship to the sun, a point of opposite polarity, which then, in accordance with the Eternal Order has the lasting capacity upon encounter to take in the positive polarity sun rays, to relax them, and to use them for its own nourishment.
FL|0|8|20|0|That a comet does this is made evident by the wide circle of vapor surrounding it, which is usually on the opposite side of the sun and stretches out in a so-called tail. But what is this tail actually?
FL|0|8|21|0|Understand, this tail is really nothing but a delaying of the sun rays which, in their initial ejection from the sun, are slowed down by the negative polarity and in their return to their attracting body appear as an extremely frail mass of vapor!
FL|0|8|22|0|Now, by this the sun has acquired another boarder, which will feed on quite a few rays until it reaches a planetary consistency. Once it has reached this degree of density, it then, necessitated by its own central weight, returns the sun its rays countless many times, without jeopardizing its own being. With its planetary status, it not only takes up the rays of the sun in its vicinity, but also sucks up masses of rays of countless other suns which surround it and then, in a way, directs them to its mother.
FL|0|8|23|0|Now we know this, but within you stirs a question and you ask, “Yes, but what does our little fly have to do with the development of comets and reflections of the rays of suns?”
FL|0|8|24|0|But here I tell you: Just a little patience, and we will let them buzz behind the great roar of a newly created world.
FL|0|8|25|0|But before we can do this we must take a look at the sun’s rays themselves and see what these imponderable light particles, streaming out of the sun, actually are in and by themselves.
FL|0|8|26|0|You already know part of this, but a little repetition will not hurt our subject, and so hear them. These outgoing light atoms are, as you know, also the first step and the origin of the little light animals I told you about before.
FL|0|8|27|0|Now the collection of such ray atoms for a later developing planet cluster are, at the same time, also collections of animal life, namely, in such a planet cluster.
FL|0|8|28|0|But how does animal life express itself upon such a new planet?
FL|0|8|29|0|The animal life expresses itself of necessity in a two-fold way and, indeed, first in a ‘negative’ life, which is the ‘plant life’ there. Once this life has received the proper saturation and is no longer able to take into itself all the polar life present, then there, naturally and of a necessity, develops a ‘positive’ polar life and, because of over-saturation of the negative life, it then has a sufficient supply of nourishment for itself.
FL|0|8|30|0|But in what form does ‘positive’ pole life first express itself?
FL|0|8|31|0|Just get a microscope and look at either a drop of water mixed with some rotting, decayed plants, or observe the extracted plant juice, and to your great amazement, you will see hordes of tiny animals; through this explanation and with very little effort, it will become clear to you how the negative life pole reverses itself and goes over into the positive polarity of life!
FL|0|8|32|0|Understand, My dear little ones, as the animal life begins to develop, it can no longer go into stagnation, but gradually begins its return to the original center of all life.
FL|0|8|33|0|Since following the eternal order of progression is observed everywhere which, in and by itself, is nothing but an always more complete and greater solidification of life, this also quite naturally happens with the returning rays, which also always become more intensive the more they approach their original point of exit, it is obvious that life cannot return to its origin in this chaotic state, but it collects itself in ever denser forms and thus returns to its eternal source.
FL|0|8|34|0|But what is then the next step wherein this first positive polar life consolidates itself.
FL|0|8|35|0|Now, My dear ones, let our fly come forth! See, this is the first animal to populate the newly-formed planet; for, as you know, even today this animal takes in such nourishment from which a trillion-fold life becomes ‘one’ life! And now you will understand why I said earlier: Just a little patience, and we will soon hear our fly buzzing behind the mighty roar of our new planet clump!
FL|0|8|36|0|Thus you will also understand the higher consolidation, how the fly comes to be a collection point of life.
FL|0|8|37|0|And, in addition, I tell you that, viewed in this light, as a collection point of life, a single fly counts for more than our entire formerly developed planet clump! And when you think about this, you will see how much higher above the outer matter life itself is, even in its first spark, and you will also see how much higher over all suns and all the planets stands the life of a single person.
FL|0|8|38|0|And when you comprehend this, it will not be hard for you to understand why I, as the Original Life of all life, as Father and Redeemer, came to earth and have made man into a child of Mine, and have prepared for him a way to My heart. And, finally, you will comprehend why I said to you, “The fly, the fly, it sings to you of victory!”
FL|0|8|39|0|The victory is not complete yet, but the following, as well as further information, will let you clearly see how much of the victory is already present – and let us leave it at that again for today!
FL|0|9|1|1|Chapter 9
FL|0|9|1|1|THE CAUSE AND NATURE OF LIGHT. (March 22, 1842)
FL|0|9|1|0|In the foregoing communication we have heard our fly, as the first animal, buzz around behind a newly developed planet!
FL|0|9|2|0|It will hardly be necessary to explain this figure of speech, yet it can be included for the sake of many weaker ones, that this is only in time and not also in space, as if someone should imagine a giant swarm of flies, like a comet’s tail, chasing after such a planet. Also this is to be understood in a timely sense, how out of one preparatory period, a more developed and a more complete period follows.
FL|0|9|3|0|This we already know, but you will now think, “What higher and more valuable victory can we get out of our poor fly? For we have seen its origin, following this revelation, and we have found that regardless of all the wonderful and extraordinary happenings, at the end there is still nothing more and nothing less than the ‘usual’ fly corresponding to God’s order, the likes of which we see plenty of during the summertime.
FL|0|9|4|0|See, that is a well-advised remark and will be useful as a basis in erecting a strong, new building.
FL|0|9|5|0|But before we begin this structure we have to proceed with a strong wall which will protect us well from an attack, for otherwise our poor fly may not come out of it so well, especially in these days in which there are so many educated and deeply scientific fly catchers.
FL|0|9|6|0|But where shall we raise our fortifications? Well, that will not be hard to figure out!
FL|0|9|7|0|Since most misconceptions and hypotheses are, where the shortsighted human understanding is least allowed to look, that is into the light-sphere of reality, there most of the theories will be constructed and, like the French fashion industry, the most recent always prevails.
FL|0|9|8|0|But what is this about which, in this scholarly age, there are almost as many theories as there are scholars?
FL|0|9|9|0|Behold, (the answer) is and remains in the light!
FL|0|9|10|0|Therefore, we will take a look first at the light itself, then this will be our fortification, and only then go on to our fly.
FL|0|9|11|0|We want to put forth the main question: What is light itself and how does it propagate?
FL|0|9|12|0|To demonstrate this, it will not be necessary to name any of the existing erroneous theories. We will set up our explanation, and this will serve everyone as a touchstone to test all the alleged theories concerning how much noble or ignoble metal they contain.
FL|0|9|13|0|So then, what is light?
FL|0|9|14|0|To understand light, as it appears in time and space, thoroughly you must view it as neither completely material nor completely spiritual, but as a material-spiritual unit, and see it as a set polarity in which the spiritual part constitutes the ‘positive’ pole and the material part is the ‘negative’ pole.
FL|0|9|15|0|But this polarity is so positioned that it does not act as front and back, but as the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ with the inner being the positive and the outer – the negative pole.
FL|0|9|16|0|But how do these polarities appear as light?
FL|0|9|17|0|See, this difficulty shall soon be removed! When you take a so-called flint stone and strike it with hardened iron, you will see a number of sparks flying at the spot where the iron hits the flint. These sparks are light; where did they get their luminescence? – from the stone, the iron, or from both?
FL|0|9|18|0|Here it is not necessary to further mention that by this act, the sparks originate solely from the iron, from which the outermost little pieces were torn off by the hard stone and kindled. The little particles of air enclosed in the pores of the iron could not evade the pressure caused by the striking action. They kindled, and in turn set detached iron particles into a hot, glowing white state.
FL|0|9|19|0|This we knew; but how is this compressed air ignited, and what is the illumination within the act of ignition?
FL|0|9|20|0|Here the matter can no longer be explained differently except to repeat again that half of the air is nothing but the material body for the intellectual spirits contained therein. The physicists would rather hear Me say “free, unbound force” instead of spirits, but since we want to be thorough, instead of taking the attribute of iron, we will take the thing affected with the attribute, which is the spirit itself or, since we are dealing with many spirits instead of just one, the spirits themselves.
FL|0|9|21|0|Having that firmly in our mind, we can follow unerringly the trail to this very thing, and then so perceive it. Since spirit is a positive polarity power, it strives continually for unbounded freedom, and is quiet in its bound state only as long as it doesn’t experience any unusual impairment from its negative polarity, or – still more understandable – from its encasement or hull. But if it suffers any kind of pressure from without, the spirit is immediately awakened from its sphere of confinement and makes its existence known by expanding. This phenomenon is then known to you as light.
FL|0|9|22|0|We have come this far, but nevertheless everyone will still say, “That may be right, but we still don’t know what the actual light in and by itself is.”
FL|0|9|23|0|But I say: “Just a little more patience, for as you all know, a mature oak tree does not fall with one blow!”
FL|0|9|24|0|We will come to grips with the actual illumination.
FL|0|9|25|0|What then is this illumination?
FL|0|9|26|0|An example will make it clearer to you. What do you see when an arrogant person receives a humiliating blow to his ego? He becomes enraged, and in his rage his whole body will begin to shake, his eyes begin to glow as though an iron forge were behind them, and his hair bristles on all sides. If he is in the company of like-minded individuals, they, too, become enraged, not in the same intensity, but according to the degree of friendship.
FL|0|9|27|0|I am of the opinion that this scene needs no further clarification but you need only to observe an army of soldiers and you cannot miss this outflow of anger, or this “war hunger” which grips thousands and thousands and hurls them unto the bloody battle.
FL|0|9|28|0|Now, if you think about this a little, we will have our illumination as good as fully explained, for the spirit, as positive polarity encased in the negative polarity, receiving a blow, becomes enraged, which in this case is an emerging awareness of its captivity, and with this awareness comes a great desire to expand or make itself free.
FL|0|9|29|0|But since the outer negative polarity is so constructed that it expands to a certain extent, but is otherwise indestructible, or rather unbreakable, the spirit inside expands as far as it can, but since it cannot break through, it withdraws quickly, but then, in erroneous judgment, tries again with renewed vigor to break through its hull, - an act which some spirits can repeat many thousands of times per second. This act is called ‘rage’ and is accompanied by ever increasing anger.
FL|0|9|30|0|What is the obvious consequence of this act, which can truly be called ‘war hunger?’
FL|0|9|31|0|Nothing else but that the other, still calm spirits, close to such an enraged spirit perceive this fever, and are set into motion against their inner polarity. This propagation of their shared fever can take place with great speed since the negative encasement of the spirits of which the air is actually composed, lie close together.
FL|0|9|32|0|Now we actually have it all; it is just this feverish activity of such spirits, which is perceived by the eye of animals as well as humans. This perception is actually what you call illumination, for the eye is provided to perceive these most subtle vibrations, and this because the eye is more or less half spirit and half material, and has the same polarity as that which is called “light”, and therefore receive and feel everything related to it.
FL|0|9|33|0|When any such polarity kindles itself in this manner, then this is the act of illumination. But the illumination itself is nothing but the effect on the surrounding spiritual polarities by the vibration caused by the original spiritual polarity. This propagation affects nearer or further distances depending on the size and degree of the originally kindled spiritual polarity, and sets them, if not into too intense, at least into a perceivable state of rage. The further the surrounding spiritual polarities are from the originally kindled spiritual polarity, the weaker is the response.
FL|0|9|34|0|Now you will say, “We understand the illumination, but we do not understand why we see the illuminated objects by their form, and also do not understand the nature of the different kinds of light, such as the light of the sun.”
FL|0|9|35|0|Here I will tell you a little more, so that his, too, will no longer be a secret, since the greatest difficulty has already been overcome.
FL|0|9|36|0|You see the actual form of objects because the solid material corresponding to the forms of the objects resists the formerly discussed propagation, or it is a double return from an object from which it received a counter thrust.
FL|0|9|37|0|Concerning the light of the sun, its illumination is the same as the familiar spark. The difference is only that the ‘white light’ stems from the vibrations of love, while the ‘red light’ stems from the vibrations of rage; and, since the light of the sun originates from the vibrations of love, its propagation is different from that originating from anger.
FL|0|9|38|0|But what constitutes the difference and how we shall arrive at our victory will be clearly shown to you next time!
FL|0|9|39|0|And so let us leave it for today!
FL|0|10|1|1|Chapter 10
FL|0|10|1|1|THE NATURE OF ETHER AND SUNLIGHT. (March 23, 1842)
FL|0|10|1|0|You may have already heard here and there that the lower a region of the earth is, the more compact, the denser is the air in that area. This is a quite natural consequence, for not only the air, but also everything else becomes denser as it radiates closer to the center. The farther away from the center, the more loosely joined are the components of the radiation.
FL|0|10|2|0|We already know what the air surrounding the earth is, partly from present information, but still more from other explanations which have been given about things in the natural world.
FL|0|10|3|0|But, to lift from you the burden of a lengthy search, I tell you again that the air, as well as all matter, is nothing but a spiritual-material, material-spiritual conflict, and the deeper these spiritual potencies lie, the angrier they are, and the higher above the planets they keep themselves, the more loving, peaceful and constant they are.
FL|0|10|4|0|Now that we understand this, it will not be hard for us, at least in a general overview, to recognize the earth with its surrounding atmosphere and according to its content, cheerfully say: The earth, and as far as its atmosphere reaches, is nothing but a gradation of spirits, having placed themselves on such a planet to begin the familiar ‘return journey.’
FL|0|10|5|0|“Yes”, you will ask, “what fills up the wide space between the sun and a planet?”
FL|0|10|6|0|The scientists say that it is an exceptionally light and compliant ether. But what would the physicists say if they had to visibly demonstrate what this ether actually is?
FL|0|10|7|0|Really, this would hardly be the fifty-dollar question! For one thing, you can’t see ether through any microscope, since not even the much denser air can be seen even partially through a microscope. The physicists could analyze the ether chemically if they could get some in their retorts. But since the actual region of the ether begins at a height of 7, 10, 14 and - towards the North Pole, at a height of 34 miles above the earth, it would be extremely difficult for the scientists to obtain ether for their research.
FL|0|10|8|0|But we want to travel on a road much more comfortable and certain, namely, that of inner faith, trust, and true love. On that road the star, Sirius, will be visually much closer to the cowboy and the shepherd than is the raindrop which has fallen on the nose of an exceedingly mathematical scientist who is on the dark road of short-sighted research, using the human mind.
FL|0|10|9|0|And so we say; the ether, likewise, is a spiritual entity which, to all planets, stands in a ‘positive’, but to the suns, in a ‘negative’ relationship.
FL|0|10|10|0|The ether consists of pure, peaceful and patient spirits; if this were not so, how difficult it would be for the planets to make their long journey around the sun at an extraordinary speed.
FL|0|10|11|0|But because the ether is formed from the most pure, peaceful and compliant spirits, nothing finds in their existence an obstacle to its motion, - be the moving entity or thing ever so small and insignificant.
FL|0|10|12|0|See now, My dear ones, now that we know this, it will no longer be difficult to ascertain the illumination of a sun and the procreation of its illumination. Yet, before we can do that, we must devote a few minutes to the shining sun, and ask ourselves, how does it look, and what happens there?
FL|0|10|13|0|This is necessary, otherwise you would, sooner or later, have to ask, how could one explain the effects to someone else, if the cause of the effect remains unknown?!
FL|0|10|14|0|That the sun is an exceedingly strong illuminating heavenly body needs no explanation, since everyone’s eyes attest to that.
FL|0|10|15|0|But how does it become so strongly illuminating? And how does it look on the surface and all the way to the center?
FL|0|10|16|0|See, this is quite another question, and it must be answered before our return to the main point can be productive.
FL|0|10|17|0|First of all, you must be aware of the sun’s enormous size. A sun is often one, yes, even several million times the size of one of its planets.
FL|0|10|18|0|What then, is the sun itself?
FL|0|10|19|0|The sun, as an entity, is a planet in a perfected state, and all planets are ‘satellites’ of this large and perfected planet.
FL|0|10|20|0|But what is the source of such an extraordinary light surrounding such a perfected planet?
FL|0|10|21|0|The light comes from the spiritual love-joy of the spirits surrounding this perfected planet.
FL|0|10|22|0|Are these spirits already totally perfected?
FL|0|10|23|0|This question must be again divided into seven different points which will, nevertheless, not be too difficult to thoroughly comprehend, since they are found together in the most beautiful order.
FL|0|10|24|0|These seven points are seven different kinds of spirits found in the sun, which jointly determine the great light of the sun.
FL|0|10|25|0|If you want to learn the inner nature of these spirits better, look to the seven commandments of neighborly love and the three commandments serving as the foundation of these seven, through which man should recognize his relationship to God, his Father and Creator. Then you have the completed cycle of the spirit formation on a sun. Also, the colors of the rainbow let one recognize this order.
FL|0|10|26|0|But now, what follows these recollections?
FL|0|10|27|0|Nothing else follows but that the sun, in its inner sphere, is a gathering place for the seven kinds of spirits. Among them are those first sent to the planets as a trial, and also those who have returned perfected. The first, still to be perfected class, form the sun’s inner contents, as the second, already perfected types, form the sun’s shining envelopment.
FL|0|10|28|0|See, if you were a little more sharp-sighted, the stumbling block would have already been removed; but, since you suffer from weak eyes and are also somewhat hard of hearing, I have to add that these spirits are the ones who, through their vibrations of love and joy, cause the actual illumination of the sun.
FL|0|10|29|0|Concerning the propagation of this light, I will draw your attention to those still-to-be-perfected spirits, which must remove themselves from the sun. Now you have the explanation of the light propagation down to a “T”, which has been discussed in connection with the formation of planet nodules, and herewith you also have the nature of the often-mentioned little atomic animals leaving the sun, through which the vibrations of the already perfected spirits are given, as a strengthening gift, to the imperfect spirits who are leaving the sun on the journey to their perfection.
FL|0|11|1|1|Chapter 11
FL|0|11|1|1|THE FLY AS AN ASSEMBLER OF LIGHT AND LIFE. (March 25, 1842)
FL|0|11|1|0|Here you will ask and say; “It is all well and fine, but what drives the first kind of spirits, which are still not complete, out of the sun into the wide, endless spaces?”
FL|0|11|2|0|And, I give you this as an answer: Nothing else but My eternal order, in which these wandering spirits from the sun have a positive polarity saturation, but basically they are only negative!
FL|0|11|3|0|But what happens if two like poles come near each other? They repel each other until the positively nourished but, within itself, still negative pole, has given up all the positive!
FL|0|11|4|0|Now, understand - our well-known little atomic animals are basically negative anxieties, and can only remain in the sun as long as they retain a negative polarity. If they too greedily take on a light saturation from the positive polarity sphere of the sun spirits, so that, according to the nature of light, there remains very little difference between them and the truly positive polarity spirits, which are already complete, they, the little atomic animals, will be quickly driven out from the positive polarities, and that with a truly spiritual speed.
FL|0|11|5|0|These expelled spirits are the actual shining light of the sun which, when it falls on a planet, imparts the positive part to it, which is the accompanying light, or rather, the continued love-joy vibration of the completed spirits.
FL|0|11|6|0|But in the negative portion, these atomic beings soon free themselves of their positive part, especially when they get close to a planet, and then, as anti-polar beings, return to the sun. Since these beings always move in a straight line because of their great speed, it is understandable why objects illuminated by the sun are seen so clearly, especially when there are no disturbances in the air.
FL|0|11|7|0|But how such an illuminated form can be seen in all its parts is due to the fact that all matter, out of which a form is made, is likewise – as you already know – nothing else but “a conflict of spiritual potencies.
FL|0|11|8|0|Therefore, when these fast light bearers from the sun encounter a form, the form then takes on, according to its composition, the parts corresponding to itself and lets the unusable parts go in all directions and at the highest rate of speed.
FL|0|11|9|0|And so the eye is only an organ for the reception of the manifold difference of the main – or the returned light, and these manifold differences are also the sculptors of all the different things in the eye, based on these light differentiations.
FL|0|11|10|0|So now that you know this and, in the natural sense, comprehend it as much as possible, it must finally be clear to you that everything which represents anything material, is basically not material but purely spiritual, except you cannot behold what is spirit because you are not yet in the spiritual polarity. But once you find yourself in spiritual polarity, then the opposite will occur, where you will see only what is spirit, but all material you will have to think of as now you think of the spiritual. Therefore, you should not wonder so much if, in the course of this communication, you come upon points, here and there, that cannot be made all so clear to you, for if all these relationships should now be made accessible to you, you would have to step out of the material completely and into the purely spiritual, and it is not yet time for that.
FL|0|11|11|0|As much as it is possible to understand the spiritual within matter, it is sufficiently shown to you in this communication, what a superficial road those take who have nothing but matter before them, and how impossible to understand those who, in their research, will lift themselves above matter.
FL|0|11|12|0|Now that we have shown the differences between light and light, illumination and illumination, made it, as much as possible, understandable to you, we have also made the bulwark for our victory building, and now we want to return to our quite forgotten little animal.
FL|0|11|13|0|But I already sense another question within you, and it is, “Yes, but what will our poor fly suddenly have to do between suns and planets, and between all these light-generating and light-bearing spirits?”
FL|0|11|14|0|This question will soon be answered if you say, “What shall the fly do between light–generating and light-bearing spirits?”
FL|0|11|15|0|And I say, the fly shall serve as a medium and shall become ‘a light-gathering spirit’!
FL|0|11|16|0|See, herein lies the solution.
FL|0|11|17|0|Could you ever say, “Now we understand this being”, and would have to testify loudly that you don’t know its standpoint, - what then would be your understanding?
FL|0|11|18|0|Truly I tell you: There would be very little difference between how ‘you’ see the fly or some other object, and the way another animal would see it, except that you can name it and say that it has six feet, two wings, a body, a head, and belongs to the class of ‘flying insects’, - and then, perhaps, add two or three hypotheses.
FL|0|11|19|0|Thus, the standpoint of a thing is the basis, from which the thing being viewed appears in its full truth.
FL|0|11|20|0|But what is the truth of a thing?
FL|0|11|21|0|Understand, ‘The spirit of a thing is the truth of it!’ As long as this is not established, everything resembles a deaf, hollow nut lacking content.
FL|0|11|22|0|Thus the standpoint is the basis, we have said it, and it must stand the test! So look then at our fly on this middle ground.
FL|0|11|23|0|Is it only spirit, or only matter?
FL|0|11|24|0|You have to say: No! It is partly material and, since it lives, it is also partly spirit. It finds itself, like countless other living beings, between the two main polarities, namely, between the positive living polarity of the sun and the opposite-standing negative polarity of the planets.
FL|0|11|25|0|This is to say: It is ‘neutral’, meaning neither all positive nor all negative. Yes, so it is right, good and true; neither light-generating alone, nor light-bearing alone, but a light collector.
FL|0|11|26|0|But what is this light?
FL|0|11|27|0|We know that it expresses itself in the mobility of life, thus light and life are one and the same, and light is only an appearance of life.
FL|0|11|28|0|But, since our fly is a collector of light, what else does it collect? Or rather, is it not then a ‘collector of life’?
FL|0|11|29|0|How does this life express itself in the fly? Does it express itself, perhaps, in a resplendent light?
FL|0|11|30|0|You must be either blind or have a fanciful eye if you can say you have seen it fly around glowing like a firefly. Yes, the fly preserves life quite exemplary within itself, it no longer lets it stream out, and it puts on a dark garment, so that the light within can better multiply.
FL|0|11|31|0|See now, My dear ones, whoever doesn’t recognize ‘the essence of humility’ in the fly, must be more than threefold blind.
FL|0|11|32|0|You know its manifold usefulness, but the light of the world doesn’t recognize it. And so the fly, the industrious, busy little animal whose every movement is in some way useful, must leave itself open to all contempt. But why? Because the fly is a collector of life, and would rather increase the life within itself, than destroy itself by showing off with it.
FL|0|11|33|0|Now do you see the standpoint? How the rays emanate from it in all directions, so that you can see, brightly illuminated, the victory, which this animal gains by fighting so courageously!
FL|0|11|34|0|But what is this victory?
FL|0|11|35|0|Let’s return to our standpoint, and mark well all the points we have heard up to now! Yes, proceeding from the first origination of light, remembering all that we have heard about light, note, that among all the possible problems, the most difficult problem to solve is this:
FL|0|11|36|0|How does this free life let itself be bound, and how does this formerly freely swarming life let itself be collected?
FL|0|11|37|0|We have learned that in the forming of planets the fly is the first visible animal to inhabit the planet. Thus we first saw the fly take up and collect the scattered life into itself, now, following the light, we see the fly again between sun and planets as a ‘collector of life’.
FL|0|11|38|0|What is the difference between now and the ancient times, when the fly was the only inhabitant of a planet?
FL|0|11|39|0|On one hand, nothing at all, for today as then, it corresponds completely to its nature and order; but on the other hand, an endless difference, for now it stands on the lowest polarity point, not only in the collection of life, but also in the return of same always to greater and more profound potencies and, finally, up to the highest potency of the original life itself.
FL|0|11|40|0|At that time, there was an endless gulf between it and the highest potency, now it is filled by man, as well as the almost endless line of being before man. Isn’t there a big difference to be found between now and then? It was shown to you then what this little animal was, now you see the same thing – but in it is also shown the victory and, therefore, there is a big difference between now and then, for at that time, no fly could sing the victory song, but now it can. So there is an endless difference between its song then and now!
FL|0|11|41|0|And just what is this difference?
FL|0|11|42|0|That is the victory!
FL|0|11|43|0|What then is the victory?
FL|0|11|44|0|Here, open your hand, and grasp the victory right under your nose! But, in case you don’t know it yet, I must spell it out for you. The preserved life is the victory!
FL|0|11|45|0|But how did the fly preserve this life?
FL|0|11|46|0|It preserved its life through its great activity, for the life needs to be exercised! It retains it further by its great humility, for life wants to be collected. It is preserved by blind submission to My will; for all life must be guided if it ever wants to find and recognize itself with ‘self confidence’,
FL|0|11|47|0|Now, when you consider these points and consider the laws which have gone out to you from Me, for the eternal preservation of life, and compare all these with another, having constantly in mind what the victory is, you will also recognize what is meant by the beginning stanza of “The Fly, which says, “The fly, the fly, it sings to you of victory!”
FL|0|11|48|0|For this little song, given to you a long time ago, consisting of a few verses, can only be regarded as the opening stanza to this great song which you now receive. Now that you recognize in this great song the actual victory song of the fly, and since we have recognized the victory, let us look to ourselves to see and pay attention to the victory, so that we become more and more able to come closer and closer to one another and thus experience the final greatest victory.
FL|0|11|49|0|Within ourselves is the reunion of each individual life with My original eternal life.
FL|0|11|50|0|How this can be achieved without the least injury, where each life remains everlastingly independent regardless of being in the most intimate union with the original life, here the fly will sing us another little song in the next and last chapter.
FL|0|12|1|1|Chapter 12
FL|0|12|1|1|THE FLY AS SYMBOL OF HUMILITY. (March 25, 1842)
FL|0|12|1|0|You have heard often enough, in the course of this communication, what is meant by this injury. Not only in this communication, but also in several other communications you have often heard how one can be an individual and at the same time be intimately united in one’s heart with the Creator. Nevertheless, it is still dark in your emotions, and faith has a hard road and the soul finds it hard to understand how man can have, spiritually, a completely independent life, and, at the same time, be so connected with the original life of the Creator, so that together they are only one life.
FL|0|12|2|0|Yes truly, such is very difficult to grasp within the earthly limitations, and I tell you: whoever does not learn it from the modest little song of the fly or, still more clearly speaking, whoever does not learn it out of the true innermost humility of the way of the cross, still more clearly speaking, whoever does not learn it from Me, the Father, who am the highest and innermost humility itself, he will never understand how Father and child can be completely one.
FL|0|12|3|0|To give you a good picture, let us look at two large objects, namely, a big (cosmic) man called the world, and another huge man called heaven.
FL|0|12|4|0|Regarding the first man, in a material sense, entire shell globes, full of suns and worlds, do not make up a nerve module of his, and this man, who in his largeness, sees himself as completely ‘one’ life, just as you see yourselves as just one life, - but does he really consist of just one life?
FL|0|12|5|0|To understand that this great cosmic man lives a manifold life, you need only to see a swarm of flies, and they will tell you with their humility that even they, as the first animals, present for themselves a complex life. How much more must man for himself recognize this, and still more an entire world full of people and countless other living beings, and still by far more the sun with its completed beings, and still much more a central sun with its most complete and almighty spirits, and finally a self-contained shell globe.
FL|0|12|6|0|But still, all these shell globes, all central suns, all next-to-central suns, all planetary suns, and all other secondary suns with their planets and all the beings on them, are truly nothing but body parts of this large ‘cosmic man’, who for himself has as good a self-contained life as every man on this earth.
FL|0|12|7|0|See, that was the view on the material side.
FL|0|12|8|0|Now let us direct our eyes to the ‘heavenly man’, whose size compared to the previously mentioned ‘cosmic man’ is as a millionth part of an atom (cosmic man) compared to an atom (heavenly man).
FL|0|12|9|0|Yes, the ‘heavenly man’ in its human shape is so big that all countless milliards of shell globes, which comprise the ‘cosmic man’, would easily fit into the tubular opening of one of its little body hairs and they could move about without even touching the sides of the little hair tubes.
FL|0|12|10|0|Now, think, how much life this heavenly man already has in one little hair tube, or at least in a part of the body corresponding to the little hair, and how much life he must have in one of his limbs, how much in his heart, and how much in his entire body! And yet, this entire ‘heavenly man’ thinks of himself as only simply existing for himself, while countless milliards and milliards of the most perfect angels and spirits, all self-contained as well, think and live just as he does.
FL|0|12|11|0|Yes, in this heavenly men, there are still other relationships in which beings that think alike and love alike, form a union which, corresponding to an earthly body or at least a part of one, represent completely a man that can think and feel entirely for itself, as if he were only an individual man!
FL|0|12|12|0|Yes, I tell you, in addition: In My endlessness, there are several such heavens, and each heaven is, by itself, a complete man, and all the heavens together form another endless man, which cannot be thought or conceived of by anyone but Me, since it is actually My body, or God in His endlessness, which thinks and feels His person and individuality in the most determined and clearest way of all, - and what an abundance of life in Him!
FL|0|12|13|0|If you now compare these two pictures a little, and then review them in the spirit, you will soon realize that in one eternal and endless Life, countless lives can move about freely and there enjoy the highest of life’s delights, while they are only a part of the principal life in God.
FL|0|12|14|0|See, thus sings the fly in its humility. And humility is man’s actual true principal fly. For, as the fly, on a continent, begins to gain victory over life within itself, so does humility within man begin to take up the freest of all life from God, and to enclose it within himself and then, through its perseverance and courage, to grow and nurture this holy treasure within, which is the “living Christ” in every real man. And when this life has gone into all parts of the soul, and through the soul into the flesh, then such an occurrence, the actual working in the spirit, is a victory, yes truly, the greatest of all victories which a man can attain, for by this victory he has captured the highest life of God within himself, through love has made it his own, and has become one with the eternal God, the Father of all Love.
FL|0|12|15|0|Tell Me, is this not a victory which the fly sings to you?
FL|0|12|16|0|But if you want to correctly understand the fly, which sings this victory to you, then ask the actual true fly within you, which is perfect humility, and it will give you the correct answer! Yes, through it you will experience what a really true victory is!
FL|0|12|17|0|But as love is the fruit of humility, so s Eternal Truth, or the Light of all Light, a Fruit of Love, and as Love grows out of Humility and Truth out of Love, therefore, it is a true growth and a true tree of Life and a true tree of all holy cognition of Life, and everything belonging to it, temporally as well as eternally.
FL|0|12|18|0|But whoever wants to investigate the secrets of life with his worldly intellect will never find them, but will lose what little he had attained during his childhood. For truly whoever doesn’t believe such an inner word when it makes itself known, - either as admonishing conscience in the heart of every higher-minded man, or as an audible word from the mouth of an awakened one – with a childlike pious simplicity and then not remaining a mere hearer of the Word, wondering about things contained within it, but is a doer of this word, I tell you yet again: Verily, verily, hearing and seeing, never gets anyone into heaven, but only doing!
FL|0|12|19|0|You have understood, from this communication, that life cannot return before it has been judged, and also, you should know from the gospel, where it says: “Not I, but the Word, which I have spoken to you, will judge you!”
FL|0|12|20|0|See, thus the Word is the judge; for the one who complies, eternal life! – and for the one who doesn’t, eternal death! For no one can arrive at a certainty except in the ‘active’ way of the cross, according to the word which preaches nothing but humility and love; but whoever is only a hearer and not a doer of the living word, which wants to judge him to life, will not be able to unite with its positive–living power, but will remain in his negative polarity of death, out of which a positive polar life will hardly ever again develop.
FL|0|12|21|0|But what are the first signs that a non-doer is headed towards a judgment of death?
FL|0|12|22|0|The first signs are the doubts of the genuineness of one or the other part of the divine revelation.
FL|0|12|23|0|What then is such a doubt in and of itself?
FL|0|12|24|0|A doubt is nothing else but an impotence of the inner life, in consequence of which the spirit sinks back into itself, and in the soul appears nothing but a dull, ordinary twilight in which a part of the light comes from the fainter and fainter rays of the spirit, but the larger part of the increasing light comes from the sense-deceiving world.
FL|0|12|25|0|Where such spiritual impotence leads doesn’t need any great explanation, unless the spirit is again soon awakened by vigorous activity according to the Word.
FL|0|12|26|0|But whoever will not go over into the true positive polarity of eternal life during the course of this life, will judge himself for the negative polarity, from which he will never arise eternally!
FL|0|12|27|0|These two polarities are respectively ‘spiritual’ and ‘material’, or living inner fruit and dead outer shell.
FL|0|12|28|0|Whoever will go over into the fruit, will go over into life, but whoever goes over into the shell, will go over into death.
FL|0|12|29|0|You should know that in all things, and more so in God, there are two polarities; and since the Divine Being is eternal, so also these two polarities must be eternal.
FL|0|12|30|0|Whoever is judged by the Word, or rather judges himself by it, takes life into himself and corresponds to the divine positive polarity, which is then the most free and unlimited existence.
FL|0|12|31|0|But whoever does not take up the Word in himself in an effective manner, but only lets it run through his negative intellect, the Word itself will judge him towards the negative polarity, which is the basic principle of all matter and thus also of death and limitation from which you can see that there will never be an end to the natural world or the spiritual world, and the natural world will remain as an eternal negative-polar support for everything spiritual and free. Which lot is the best for all eternities, to be incorporated in either the negative of the positive polarity of God, that is: to be an eternally joyful, most free angel-spirit, or a banned Satan in a dead stone – such you may now decide for yourselves.
FL|0|12|32|0|The truth is, indeed, everywhere for the living, but for the dead there is no light in all eternity.
FL|0|12|33|0|And that should carry with it such as the truth should always say; and such is an exceedingly good thing, yes, that is the eternal ring of life which you should penetrate and it does not turn itself to entertain the intellect, but earnestly in the deed, and only by this the truth, as the true light of life in it, arises and fully wafts through it.
FL|0|12|34|0|See, if you now understand this, then you will also understand that the tone is as the pipe, and the light as the life, and the reward as the work, or the cognition or self-knowledge of the eternal life in itself as the deed according to the Word; and as the mountain, so the bend in the road, or as the life is lived, so also is its pole; and as the heart, so is its voice, or as the humility within the heart, so also the living Word within it.
FL|0|12|35|0|Now you will no longer ask: “Who may comprehend this within himself. For whom will this olive branch ripen?” For you know, from the course of this communication, what the earth is and what light is, and you will, therefore, also know and easily understand how truth is a light to the light and a light to the light for judgment, i.e. either for judgment which turns life to life, or the reverse as you already know.
FL|0|12|36|0|As you think through everything that was said, can you still not understand the question: “Can you now court suns as you desecrate the earth in the light?” Or in plain English: Can you serve two masters?
FL|0|12|37|0|For whoever courts suns, or living perfection, how can he turn to the world with this light, for profit? Or, so that you may understand it more distinctly: How will a man seeking divine truth with his intellect, arrive at eternal life, if he doesn’t want to let the Word in him become deed?!
FL|0|12|38|0|Yes, he is one who, in the stolen light, profanes by his indolence the very ground upon which he should have been active to attain life! Don’t the physicists know that like polarities never attract but always repel?! The earth in itself is lazy and idle, how can it be enlivened by inactivity?
FL|0|12|39|0|Therefore, it is clear that as one cannot serve two masters, - so not at the same time, his idle intellect and the living deed.
FL|0|12|40|0|But whoever can court suns should not profane the earth with the light, but should bless it by his deed, so that the earth also becomes a sun to him.
FL|0|12|41|0|And so the call is to the dark doubter, that he should flee when I bring down suns. But where shall he flee?
FL|0|12|42|0|He may ask the fly and it will tell him which train life takes, and how it should return equipped with great profits; but the fly will also tell him where he may flee, yes, rather must flee, if he will not return to the eternal life of all life by action according to the Word.
FL|0|12|43|0|Whoever has opened his eyes just a little bit, will need not search too long to see the vast endlessness full of deer, who truly run the race to the ultimate finish where life has taken its course in our fly; for “deer” and “always becoming freer life “ signify one and the same thing.
FL|0|12|44|0|Knowing this, you also know who and how he can lift the endless chain of existence, which climbs up to the firstborn of all light and life.
FL|0|12|45|0|But here the question is put to the intellectual, whether also he, the idle, is able to lift this chain and likewise the second and last question. If you cannot find the footprints of truth, namely, through the deed, who then will release you from this night of eternal death?
FL|0|12|46|0|I think this last question needs no further clarification, since you will know from this script, that one must be a living, active doer of the Word in order to be released from the night of eternal death - and not only a hearer, or ultimately even a critic, what is even worse, a despiser and then even a denier of My Word.
FL|0|12|47|0|But whoever wants to be a real doer of the Word must be totally earnest, so he can say with My dear David: “God is my true earnestness, I will sing and compose, that is also my glory. In good health, you psalters and harps, I will be up early. I will thank Thee, Oh Lord, among the peoples and will sing praises to You among the masses, for Thy grace reaches as far as the heavens extend, and Thy truth reaches higher than the clouds. Lift up Thyself, Oh God, above the heavens, Your Glory over every land, so that Your dear friends are released, help with Your right hand hearken to me!”
FL|0|12|48|0|Doesn’t David sing here that God is his true earnestness?
FL|0|12|49|0|But how else can God be with man except in the Word? Thus the Word must be man’s earnestness; therefore he should sing it or hear it and then write it or do it; and that is the glory of the light of man himself.
FL|0|12|50|0|Here David calls to the psalters and harps, and wants to get up early, in order to do what?
FL|0|12|51|0|Nothing but the Word; for whoever takes up the Word into his heart and does accordingly, and does such among nations and among people, or he finds himself in the middle of the two well-known polarities, and strives through them towards God, and doesn’t let himself to be led astray by nations or by people, or by his intellect, nor by his indolence, he it is who thanks and sings praises to Me with the best psalters and harps.
FL|0|12|52|0|Yes, truly, whoever does so, to whom God is a true earnestness, as to David, he knows quite well how far My grace extends, or how far the life from Me goes out into all the eternal spaces, which are the heavens, of which enough was told to you today, he also knows what the “clouds of truth” are, namely the spirits of eternal life.
FL|0|12|53|0|Yes, to whom God is a true earnestness, he recognizes the victory within himself and calls likewise with David: “Lift Thyself, oh God, above the heavens – or over this my former life – and Thy Glory – or Thy living light – stream out over the lands of my being, so that thereby, all dear friends or all who have turned themselves toward life, at whichever level they may be, will be released of all that is death!”
FL|0|12|54|0|Yes, to whom God, as to David, is a true earnestness, will also call to Him, “Lord, my God and Father, - see, my heart overflows with love to You! See, out of the depth of my humility, I implore and cry to You that You might help me with Your right hand, or that You might give me the true light of life, and then I could become one, single complete life with You; and so hearken to me, my God!”
FL|0|12|55|0|See, that is a proper supplication for him who, by himself, can say in the spirit and in all truth: “God is my true earnestness!”
FL|0|12|56|0|For to whom God is a true earnestness, he will turn himself towards God completely, and will not look back to the world with one eye, and look towards God with the other one. He will not lift only his eyes to God, but his entire being! But, as it is these days, believe Me, there is very little earnestness towards God, and mankind has fallen completely into the greatest half-heartedness and the remaining drop of it living power is used solely for world purposes!
FL|0|12|57|0|The amount of living power returning to Me you will be able to count on your fingers without much trouble, and be assured that the words “countless” and “unending” will not be used here.
FL|0|12|58|0|But should that make us anxious? Oh, My dear little children, by no means! For everything will proceed the way that My judging Word prescribes, either upwards or downwards, and so, quite plainly spoken, although this planet was redeemed for a very high ransom, and was placed in the center of My two endless polarities, there are still very many planets in the whole of infinity upon which more faithful children are walking than upon this most ungrateful one – nevertheless, I have done it for no planet but this one!
FL|0|12|59|0|As yet, eternity has not come to an end; its continuation is endless! Woe to this earth if I turn My heart away from it toward another.
FL|0|12|60|0|Mark well, all that you have received in this fly, and act accordingly! Stay away from your intellect, but remain all that much closer to your heart, then you will recognize the true victory of life within yourselves, and you will be able to swing yourselves up to the sevenfold light, and to the threefold light above the sevenfold light!
FL|0|12|61|0|And I tell you this in addition: If anyone has a doubt and cannot fully believe this communication, so that through it he becomes alive in his heart, he will do better not to touch it for, if he has touched upon it, he has also reinforced the inner judge towards death. But if he has not touched upon it, his judgment will also be easier, and the way to the negative pole more tolerable and, perhaps, after eternities, also reversible.
FL|0|12|62|0|But whoever reads it and considers it as a powerful signpost towards life, and does accordingly, truly, he already has the victory within himself, all of which is your Father’s sole, holy love-will eternally. Amen.
