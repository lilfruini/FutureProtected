HPS|0|1|1|1|﻿THE HEALING POWER OF SUNLIGHT
HPS|0|1|1|0|Regarding the matter, one does not have to be too particular about the precise measure and weight, but one should be concerned, above all, to have the right faith and proper trust in Me, for you know that I am quite capable of drowning someone in a few drops of water and keeping alive another one who has fallen into the ocean.
HPS|0|1|2|0|The materials used in the sun cure have no effect anyway, except that they have to absorb and retain the sunrays under the prescribed conditions. Once these materials have served their purpose and are used for cases of sickness, together with the given diet, with proper faith as prescribed, they will not fail to be effective.
HPS|0|1|3|0|Above all, an unselfish good will and firm faith are needed, especially on the part of the helper, in order to help a sufferer with this revealed grace of Mine through the power of My Name, for you cannot always expect the sufferer to possess a complete faith. However, if the sufferer also fully believes, the effect of the remedy will be all the more certain and speedy.
HPS|0|1|4|0|In ancient times when the earth was already inhabited by humans, these people used the light and warmth of the sun as the sole means of restoring their health whenever they felt some discomfort in their body.
HPS|0|1|5|0|They placed their sick in the sun, bared those parts of the body where the sick felt a weakness, discomfort or pain, and he soon became better.
HPS|0|1|6|0|If the sick had something wrong with his stomach, he had to expose the stomach area to the sunlight for a while, drink some water from a pure spring which had been exposed to the sun, and his condition soon improved.
HPS|0|1|7|0|As a matter of fact, the early dwellers on this earth hardly ever drank water which had not, if at all possible, been exposed to the sunlight for a while.
HPS|0|1|8|0|They did not have any deep and covered wells, and no one would drink water from a spring to which the sunlight could not penetrate, for they knew, and could also see it, that bad and sometimes even evil spirits dwell in such water until they are driven out through the power of the heavenly sunlight.
HPS|0|1|9|0|Look, there lies a deep truth in what has been said so far, for the light of the sun carries purer spirits with it, as you can well imagine. These spirits are closely related to the substantial parts of the human soul. When the soul is strengthened through the influence of such pure spirits it can easily and quickly overcome some weakness in its body, since the health of the body always solely depends on a sufficiently strong soul.
HPS|0|1|10|0|Wherever some weakness first appears in the substantial parts of the soul and the soul is unable to gain strength for these weakened parts in a proper way, it resorts to its own nerve essence, drawing from it what it lacks. The result is, as in discharged electrical bottles an obvious shortage in the nerves, of the life fluidum through which alone the right current is sustained.
HPS|0|1|11|0|The nerves become as if hungry, absorb still impure nourishment from the blood, and when this happens it, of course, leads to an unnatural life process in the nature of the flesh, resulting in the development of all kinds of sickness, depending on how they relate, based on the deeper soul calculations, to one or the other part of the soul that has become weakened.
HPS|0|1|12|0|However, since in the purer sun spirits all those particular soul substances are present out of which the soul is made, it is easy for the soul to take from them all that it lacks for its strengthening, thereby restoring the former order in its nerve essence and through it, in its nerves and blood, the proper natural life current.
HPS|0|1|13|0|Because of this, a proper homeopathic treatment is, in many respects, much more preferable to any allopathic treatment. For, through homeopathy the soul becomes the physician for its body when it has absorbed from outside something it lacked or in which, at least, it was weakened.
HPS|0|1|14|0|With allopathic treatment, however, the body is forced to first become the physician for its soul. And only when the soul, usually through great misery of the body, has retained its health, can it retroactively begin to restore its body. This is surely the most unsuitable way for regaining the full health of the body which is obvious when one looks at the lengthy process of a very sick body’s recovery.
HPS|0|1|15|0|Thus, homeopathy is a proper healing method, but note that there are two kinds of homeopathy, namely:
HPS|0|1|16|0|First, there is a special one (Note: Founded by Hahnemann) whose results are not quite certain because even the most skilled physician cannot always recognize for sure where and in which parts the soul is weakened. Therefore, he is unable to apply the correct soul specific. This is, of course, possible to a physician who is reborn in the spirit, whereas for one who is not completely, or usually not at all reborn, it is, notwithstanding his discernment and skill, difficult or even impossible.
HPS|0|1|17|0|For this reason the second kind of homeopathy which, to distinguish it from the first, I will call the general, should preferably be taken into consideration, as with it no physician could make a mistake – if at least he has some skill.
HPS|0|1|18|0|And this type of homeopathy I have mentioned to you in advance on the 16th of July 1851, concerning the healing power of the sunrays.
HPS|0|1|19|0|Now you would naturally ask: “How can this be done?”
HPS|0|1|20|0|I have already shown you one way which is, or would be, sufficient if men would observe the way of life today which was faithfully observed by mankind in the past.
HPS|0|1|21|0|The present way of life, when because of all kinds of artificial foods, the soul is deprived of, rather than supplied with nutrients, or given completely bad ones, the ancients’ method of using the sunlight is not sufficiently effective.
HPS|0|1|22|0|Therefore, I will tell you of several treatments, including the necessary diet. If this is strictly observed using the shown sunlight medicine, but mind this: very strictly: you can, with certainty, heal every illness whatever it may be.
HPS|0|1|23|0|Even external injuries to the body can be healed if this medicine is dispensed in the proper way.
HPS|0|1|24|0|The other things will follow soon.
HPS|0|1|25|0|Now let us look at the special ways how the health-giving substance from the sunlight can best be combined with some fine substances and how it can then be used in cases of sickness.
HPS|0|1|26|0|It is obvious that the sunlight substance can be combined with a variety of materials, if you only look at a meadow.
HPS|0|1|27|0|Just pick any little plant, smell and taste it, and both smell and taste will tell you: “We originate from the light and warmth of the sun!”
HPS|0|1|28|0|If you expose a sheet of glass for some extended time to the sunlight, it will begin to show all kinds of colors on its outer surface. Why not on the inner surface, too? Because the inner surface is not exposed to the sunrays first strike.
HPS|0|1|29|0|Place a pot plant in a dark cellar. Even if it does flower, the blossoms will show no color at all or only a very pale color.
HPS|0|1|30|0|This shows that the colors of flowers and fruits are also a work of the active light spirits of the sun ray.
HPS|0|1|31|0|In those countries which you call “the hot ones”, the opalescence of plants and even animals is far more vivid and richer than is the case in the temperate, or even the cold, zone where most things assume a grey shade, do not have a very strong perfume and often have a harsh and bitter taste equal to the harshness and bitterness of the judged spirits banned in the earth.
HPS|0|1|32|0|Here one could say: “But if all the species of plants and also the minerals, especially in the hot zones, contain so much of the sun’s light substance, no further artificial methods would be needed to draw from the sun what can easily be obtained in quite a natural way.
HPS|0|1|33|0|This is true, and so far most medical practices have been based on this.
HPS|0|1|34|0|Whoever uses known healing herbs will certainly always feel their effect. But no healing herb exists which is able to absorb all the healing substance from the sunrays. Every plant absorbs only what is homogeneous to it and cannot absorb anything else, since its structure is such that it can absorb from the sunlight only what is required by it.
HPS|0|1|35|0|If a physician were able to establish from a sick soul exactly which life-specifics have become weak within it, or are even lacking, and knew also the little herb which contains these particular life specifics, he would definitely be able to restore a sick soul or, which is the same, a sick person, to complete health.
HPS|0|1|36|0|But since such deeper knowledge of a person and his soul is as unknown to an ordinary physician as is as yet undiscovered continent, medicine is and remains to him a guess rather than knowledge.
HPS|0|1|37|0|So what people learned through experience and occasional lucky experiments concerning the healing powers of plants, minerals and animals, they mostly apply to the healing of their sick, and with most physicians the Nordic saying could be applied where such a physician is compared to a club: “If the club is lucky enough to strike the sickness, the patient improves, but if the club strikes the patient instead of the disease, the patient dies!”
HPS|0|1|38|0|Here we are not concerned with old experiences or new test results for the healing of people but with an arcanum(13), as it were, which is capable of re-animating sick mankind, as long as the body mechanism allows it, in the same way that an ever-stronger growing light in spring re-animates plants and animals, provided their organism is capable of receiving such a re-animation. For, mind this, there does not exist an arcanum for an eternal life of the body together with the soul on earth, as dreamed of by some miracle physicians. However, to the extent that in My order a person is allowed to live his physical life, he is able – with a proper diet and the right use of the arcanum – to reach a ripe old age in good health.
HPS|0|1|39|0|Thanks to these explanations, everyone can understand how the most varied life-specifics out of the rays of the sun can do something with nature, and so we can now begin with the particular method for the absorption of such sunrays.
HPS|0|2|1|1|FIRST METHOD FOR THE ABSORPTION OF SUNRAYS
HPS|0|2|1|0|Take a cup made of dark violet glass with a 3 to 4 zoll (± 4.50 to 6 cm) diameter, about 1 zoll (1 zoll = 1.5 cm) high, and with a very smooth rim. Have a lid made for this cup to cover it hermetically (air tight).
HPS|0|2|2|0|Once you have acquired such a vessel which is best fit for this, then take the little milk sugar globules(1402) that you know and scatter them on the bottom of the cup in such a way that they are not covered by other globules. Then expose the cup with the globules to the rays of the sun for a longer time and the globules will absorb the sunrays and all its specific spirits. If then a sick person, after having adhered to the proper diet, is given 1, 2 or at the most 3 of such globules, preferably before sunrise, he will greatly improve, beginning with the 3rd, but no later than the 4th day. For the soul will take from it what it lacks and thus strengthened, it will discard what it cannot use and thereupon it will easily attain the proper life-current for its body.
HPS|0|2|3|0|In summer when the sun is most effective, it is sufficient if the above-mentioned little milk sugar globules are exposed to the sun for 1 month. However, they may not be exposed to the sun all the time while it is visible in the firmament, but only for as long as the sun is still standing at an angle of 45 degrees. Below that, because of the low angle of the rays, their light and impact is too weak and has little or no effect at all upon the globules. Therefore, they must be carefully covered with the described lid and kept in a cool dry place until the next day.
HPS|0|2|4|0|To store these sunlight impregnated globules you must get little bottles made from dark-violet glass, made airtight with a clean stopper from the same glass, only then can they be well sealed by means of a bladder (plastic today). They must be kept in a cool and dry place.
HPS|0|2|5|0|In spring or autumn the exposure of the globules to the rays of the sun would take about 3 months. All further manipulation remains the same. In winter it is impossible to prepare this remedy since the angle of the sunrays is too great and makes them ineffective.
HPS|0|2|6|0|The diet is the same as used in homeopathy with great care, except that one has to start with this diet 3-7 days earlier than in ordinary homeopathic treatment. During the preceding diet the patient may have several drinks of water during the day which has been exposed to the sunlight.
HPS|0|2|7|0|As a drinking vessel a lighter shade of violet glass, or at least a little porcelain pot glazed with this color, is preferable to anything else.
HPS|0|2|8|0|In order to make the water particularly effective, you could also use a burning glass of at least 1.5 schuh (45 cm) diameter with a focal distance of, at the most, 3 feet and with it direct the concentrated sunrays, as they appear in the focal point onto the water in such a way that the focal point, depending on the height of the vessel, falls 1, 2 or up to 3 zoll (1.5 to 4.5 cm) below the surface of the water, that is, more in the center of the water mass. However, the focal point must not be more than half a minute in the water as thereby the certain invigorating spirits of the water would be captivated too much by the light spirits from the sun, and with weaker natures such a water would produce a too violent effect which would be detrimental rather than beneficial to the subsequent main cure.
HPS|0|2|9|0|Also a good, pure wine, provided it is not kept in oak containers, but either in skins, as in former times, or in glass bottles, or maybe even casks from sweet wood, can be treated in the same way as the water and is preferable in the case of people with weak nerves.
HPS|0|2|10|0|After the use of this remedy, the same diet – according to the season – must be observed for 3 months. The patient should be outdoors in the fresh air often, when the sun is shining, and he will be completely restored to health.
HPS|0|2|11|0|Married couples shall note that, during the time of treatment, they must refrain from sexual intercourse, for the sperm of both sexes is a principal life-specific and the soul must not be deprived of it during the restoration of its body.
HPS|0|2|12|0|If a person who has thus been restored to health subsequently lives a moderate and orderly life, he will not easily fall ill again and may reach a ripe old age.
HPS|0|2|13|0|This is one method by which the sunlight can be used to serve people’s health. But another one and several more methods I will add to your knowledge soon.
HPS|0|3|1|1|SECOND METHOD FOR ABSORBING THE RAYS OF THE SUN
HPS|0|3|1|0|If the first method presents difficulties, which can easily be the case, to enable you from acquiring all the necessary things, you may absorb the rays of the sun also in another way, similar to the first one, in order to help a sufferer.
HPS|0|3|2|0|Instead of the violet glass cup, you may also use a ceramic cup or bowl with either a completely black or – even better – a dark blue glaze and instead of the mild sugar globules you may use another pure sugar, crumbled to pea-size pieces and also placed in such a way that not one piece is covered by another. This sugar is exposed to the sun during the same time of the day as with the previous method for at least 2 months and carefully kept overnight and afterward, as earlier described, in a dark container well protected from the influence of the air.
HPS|0|3|3|0|The use is the same as with the first kind, the only difference is that the dose must be a little stronger because in the sugar crumbs in the ceramic vessel the sunrays do not concentrate as much as in the other type.
HPS|0|3|4|0|In illnesses which need quick help and relief, the remedy can, in both methods, be given to the patient immediately. But where it is possible, the earlier described preliminary diet with the drinking of sunned water should be observed as this saves the soul considerable effort and the subsequent healing is surer and faster.
HPS|0|3|5|0|These sun impregnated sugar crumbs may also be effectively used as follows:
HPS|0|3|6|0|After the patient has taken, during the day, several glasses of sunned water, let him lie down in a good bed where in a few hours he will properly perspire.
HPS|0|3|7|0|When this happens, take 1-3 crumbs of the sunned sugar, dip them into a drop of perspiration and administer it to him. He will then be feeling a slight pressure in his head and stomach and a sickly chill all over his body. This chill will be followed by a light diarrhea, whereupon he will be completely healed.
HPS|0|3|8|0|The described effect may, with some people, last 3 days, with others even up to 7 days, depending on the patient’s light or heavy nature.
HPS|0|3|9|0|Following his recovery, the patient should continue on the diet for a few weeks and drink a glass of sunned water from time to time. He will then be completely cured of whatever disease he may have had.
HPS|0|3|10|0|Here it is of importance to note that with illnesses which result from plethora (too much blood) a preceding diet is absolutely essential, as it is prescribed in the best homeopathy.
HPS|0|4|1|1|DIET
HPS|0|4|1|0|Abstinence from all sour and spiced foods and drinks, especially from beer and coffee.
HPS|0|4|2|0|Coffee is by far the worst man has chosen from the vegetable kingdom for his enjoyment. This fruit was created for horses, donkeys, camels and similar animals on earth. It animates them and strengthens their nerves. With humans, however, this bean has the opposite effect. It spoils the blood, excites the genitals and, if gratification cannot soon follow, the result is a total stupefaction of the sensitive parts of the body. Since it causes the soul a great deal of effort to remove, from the body, soul potencies destined for coarse animals, he becomes weary, indolent, careless, often mournful, gloomy and sad. I tell you: a cup full of sweetened liquid manure would be far more wholesome for the human body than the roasted brown soup of the coarse animal food.
HPS|0|4|3|0|I have drawn your attention to the harmfulness of coffee only because I know only too well how much of humanity, especially the female kind, depends on this donkey fodder, when nothing could be more harmful to their nature than this drink. And hardly anything else would make the body, especially for the female one, more unreceptive for a good medicine than this coffee. Therefore, it must be carefully avoided in any state of sickness and during any cure, especially during this sun-homeopathic treatment, otherwise the medicine would not work at all.
HPS|0|4|4|0|If a strong coffee drinker had taken poison and would, following the poison, have a considerable quantity of coffee, even the effect of the poison would be destroyed by it.
HPS|0|4|5|0|If coffee can even destroy poison, it is obvious that it will all the more easily destroy the mild and gentle soul-specifics effect of the homeopathic sun ray medicine now described to you. Therefore, one has to beware of such foods which hinder the influence of noble and pure medicines even worse than the well-known opium.
HPS|0|4|6|0|Fresh cereals cooked either in a broth made from pure and healthy meat or in good fresh, not too fat milk, eaten in moderation are to be preferred to all other foods. But also other foods, with the exception of beans and lentils, may be eaten;
HPS|0|4|7|0|for instance, corn cooked in water or milk, but liquid as soup or gruel also well-cooked rice as a soft gruel, and millet gruel prepared in the above-mentioned broth or milk.
HPS|0|4|8|0|Well cooked and healthy meat is also not detrimental, but it should be eaten in moderation with cooked fruit like apples, pears or prunes. Meat always contains soul specifics of a worse and lower kind. But if it is eaten with fruit, these specifics are softened and such food will do the patient good.
HPS|0|4|9|0|The so-called: “green foods” should be avoided, at least during the time of the treatment; for the nourishing soul specifics of the edible herbs and roots (also of potatoes) are much more impure than the ones in the flesh of animals and should be used sparingly.
HPS|0|4|10|0|This second method shown to you (i.e. the use of coarse sunned sugar) is, if used properly, full of faith and trust in My active help, quite as effective as the first one and easier to carry out. It only needs a little more time, but this should not be too important.
HPS|0|4|11|0|Whoever is able to prepare the remedy according to the first method is actually better off, but if that is difficult for him, I can bless the second method just as I do the first, provided he has the right faith and trust.
HPS|0|4|12|0|Without My help and blessing no medicine will work anyway, except to the body’s detriment and often eventually also to that of the soul.
HPS|0|4|13|0|Soon about a third method.
HPS|0|5|1|1|THIRD METHOD OF ABSORBING THE RAYS OF THE SUN
HPS|0|5|1|0|Seek to obtain a salt from which all mineral components, especially arsenic, have been eliminated. The best would be an absolutely pure sulfuric salt or a pure sea salt which would have to be thoroughly calcined until it no longer emits any visible vapor. Then it should be carefully pulverized.
HPS|0|5|2|0|This salt, just as in the two previous methods the sugar, would have to be exposed to the rays of the sun for 2 or 3 months and also in a type of vessel as earlier described, preferably of a dark violet color.
HPS|0|5|3|0|When the salt is exposed to the sun it is of importance that, several times during the day, it is stirred up well with a glass stick, specially made for this purpose. This stirring up or mixing is necessary because the finely pulverized salt would be lying approximately 4 mm. high in the vessel in which it is exposed to the sun. So that all the salt particles at the bottom are exposed to the rays of the sun, the stirring must be done in such a way that not too many furrows or little heaps are formed. If this cannot be avoided, they must be leveled so that the sunrays can work evenly on the whole surface.
HPS|0|5|4|0|After such salt types have been sufficiently impregnated by the rays of the sun during the prescribed time, just as the sugar in the first and second method, they have to be protected from the effects of the atmospheric air in the driest place of the house, in dry boxes.
HPS|0|5|5|0|When one wants to use it in case of some illness, special little spoons have to be made for this purpose, either of pure gold or pure silver, for taking out the needed quantity of salt. The tiny scoop must have a capacity no bigger than a lentil would fill, and this quantity is quite sufficient for adults. Children under 14 years shall be given only half of this quantity and children under 6 only a quarter. For this salt, especially the pure sulfur salt, has an extremely strong effect and acts particularly upon the bone structure, as well as on the teeth and hair, and is, therefore, to be used above all in cases of bone fractures. If someone has broken a leg and the fracture is properly set and put in splints, it will be healed completely a few days after the salt has been taken.
HPS|0|5|6|0|If it is a complicated fracture and the flesh and muscles of the leg are injured, such injury can also be treated externally, either with compresses of sunned water or with the well-known greenish arnica ointment, but 1 to 2 doses of the described salt must always be added to the water and to the ointment.
HPS|0|5|7|0|However, for internal use, at the most 1-1/2 doses of this salt may be used even with the most robust person and it may be taken only once, for if it were taken more often, it would soon bring death instead of healing. Since it acts mainly on the bone structure, it would promote the ossification (bone growth) to such an extent that a person could soon become ossified in all his parts.
HPS|0|5|8|0|When properly used, it gives the whole body a proper current and gradually brings about a complete change in the body, so that after a year, nothing is left of the body the soul has been carrying around laboriously a year ago. Even teeth that people have lost are replaced, but the older teeth may become longer. Therefore, the doses must not be exceeded, as otherwise there may be trouble with a person’s teeth.
HPS|0|5|9|0|This shows the special effect of this salt. Properly used it heals, just as the earlier mentioned remedies, every physical disease, but great care must be taken. With the earlier shown methods, no particular damage can be done if the patient, considering his nature and the disease, is administered a somewhat larger dose or, if necessary, repeated in a few days. But with this salt there must never be a repeat, except after 10 years, and the dose must never exceed the prescribed measure.
HPS|0|5|10|0|The diet must be observed quite as carefully as with the earlier described methods. But the patient must abstain from sour drinks or foods for at least 14 days longer than with the other methods. This salt contains exceedingly intensive soul specifics, which are more or less also contained in every other acid, and it would initially attract the homogeneous soul specifics from all the other acids that enter the stomach and body, increasing them excessively, and the effect would be the same as if one already taken a double or triple dose in the beginning.
HPS|0|5|11|0|Furthermore, this salt has the effect, that if put on the tongue of a person near death, provided his organism is not yet too badly ruined, he can either recover completely or at least prolong his life span.
HPS|0|5|12|0|As to the question of which type of sulfate should be used, the answer is this: I know better than all the chemists and pharmacists that a variety of preparations are produced and many more than are so far known can be produced and called “sulfuric salts”, since sulfur – partly a mineral, partly a fat, originating from the inner bowels of the earth – contains as many types of salt as it does various mineral parts.
HPS|0|5|13|0|However, all this I do not call the general sulfur; what I describe as “salt” is the acid in the sulfur. And the acid, as it is known to you, is made of two kinds, namely the familiar smoking brown kind and the refined one free from water.
HPS|0|5|14|0|This latter kind shall be treated, so that it crystallizes and the crystals have then to be freed from all moisture content by some suitable method.
HPS|0|5|15|0|After having been dried as far as possible, the crystals are then put in a clean porcelain vessel and ground to powder with a pestle. While grinding, a quantity of as much as possible arsenicfree blossoms of sulfur – to one teaspoonful of the salt a quarter of that – is added and well mixed into the other powder. This mixture is then the sulfate to be used as described above for the required purpose.
HPS|0|5|16|0|In this way, a pharmacist or chemist – if he will take the trouble – can prepare the needed sulfate, but it will not be easy, because the crystals won from the pure sulfuric acid are difficult to dry. Here time will be helpful to achieve this if the sulfuric acid is allowed to crystallize until the crystals have become quite solid.
HPS|0|5|17|0|A slightly easier, but just not as quick method to prepare crystals from such an acid could also be the following: Take a glass cup with an even base (it is better if it is made of dark glass than light glass). Place this cup in the sun--or on quite hot sand in winter, which is, however, not as good--and pour at once as much of this acid into it as is needed for the acid to cover the base one drop deep, thus not exceeding a quarter line.
HPS|0|5|18|0|Then keep this acid exposed to the sunrays, and the light of the sun and its warmth will lift the watery moisture from the acid, and the base of the glass will then be visibly coated with a very thin crust. This crust then is already just crystallized pure sulfuric acid. Again pour more acid over this crust and let it evaporate in the manner mentioned above.
HPS|0|5|19|0|If somebody prepares this compound in winter, he should not choose a living room or an ordinary food kitchen for it, but he has to have a separate little laboratory for this purpose because the water vapors separating from the acid would have a harmful influence on every human chest.
HPS|0|5|20|0|Otherwise, proceed as in the case of evaporation by means of the sun which--as already mentioned--is by far the most preferable one because in this case, the crystals are already saturated by the sunrays in advance and later, in the second saturation, become so much stronger.
HPS|0|5|21|0|There are still several other methods of causing such concentrated pure sulfuric acid to crystallize.
HPS|0|5|22|0|It is not as difficult to produce the crystal as it is to produce completely arsenic-free flowers of sulfur.
HPS|0|5|23|0|For producing these crystals the pure white concentrated English sulfuric acid is preferable, as its preparation is purest in England.
HPS|0|5|24|0|But the required sulfur salt in a very useable form could also be obtained in a different way; however, as too many quite expensive devices and a minimum time of one to two years would be required for its extraction, I refrain from describing such an extraction of the very useable sulfur salt to you in detail; but I will give you later, on occasion, through the servant, a specific description of it, together with the necessary drawing of the devices.
HPS|0|5|25|0|With this, the third method has been completely disclosed and its application has been shown to you.
HPS|0|5|26|0|But note well, common table salt as well as alkali, either from salt or from different plants, are not at all suitable for this preparation, because the first one, namely the table salt, contains too many coarse mineral parts in it and is not even free of arsenic, and the alkali acts in a too dissolving and occasionally too destructive way. Therefore only the salts shown are suitable for this preparation.
HPS|0|5|27|0|And with this, for today you have been given a sufficient explanation about this point regarding the knowledge you wanted.
HPS|0|5|28|0|But before we continue with a fourth method, I will add a little bit about the third method that is specifically about the preparation containers which could also be used for the first and second methods in case of emergency. And what I have to tell you about them is the following:
HPS|0|5|29|0|In case it is difficult or impossible for you to obtain any one of the described containers (that is, in this year of 1851), you could instead have one fabricated for you--but nevertheless of the same color, if possible--one made of so-called papier-mâché similar to the so-called tobacco boxes. But the mass should be quite thick, thoroughly baked and lacquer-coated.
HPS|0|5|30|0|If the lacquerer is not able to achieve the dark purple color even here--I am talking about such manufacturers in this town (Graz); in Vienna, Bohemia, Paris and London this would be easily achievable--then the black color would also do.
HPS|0|5|31|0|But the black color is of a nature that it is not very selective in absorbing; it takes up everything that it can get, lock, stock and barrel. Therefore I advise you, with regard to the black containers, not to allow sunrays to fall directly on the absorption medicaments contained below, but through a slightly bluish, but otherwise very pure glass which has to be very well fitted to the container.
HPS|0|5|32|0|With the sugar preparations, you would do best to slightly affix the glass mentioned above to the edge of the container by means of dissolved rubber; this way, overnight or on days when the sun does not shine, you only have to cover the container prepared like this with its contents of medicament with a fitting piece of fabric and to set it in a dry place. But for the salts, a special lid should be manufactured which exactly fits the container to begin with; but in place of the top of the lid a glass plate as described above should be cemented on that seals it hermetically. For with the salts, as you know, frequent stirring has to occur. If the container is furnished with such a lid that one can remove easily, such stirring can easily be accomplished. But the container for the preparation of the salts would have to be lacquered twice as well and strongly as for the preparation of the sugar medicaments.
HPS|0|5|33|0|Now having said this in advance, we can directly proceed to the fourth method without hindrance.
HPS|0|6|1|1|A FOURTH METHOD OF USING THE SUNLIGHT FOR HEALING PURPOSES
HPS|0|6|1|0|Take a crucible made of serpentine stone which holds a good half liter. Take also a pestle of the same serpentine stone for stirring and grinding. Then see that you obtain from a butcher 1/4 to 3/8 liter of lamb’s blood or, if that is not available, healthy calf’s blood. Pour this blood into the above-mentioned vessel and if one such vessel is too small, take two and put half the quantity into each one which would then make 1/8 or 3/16 liter. Then expose this blood to the sun, as previously described, and keep stirring it repeatedly while the sun is shining upon it. But during the night you must carefully protect it from the effects of the air and keep it in a cool place.
HPS|0|6|2|0|This stirring and exposing the blood in the sun is kept going until the blood is totally dried up. When that has happened, you shall pulverize it in the same vessel and with the same pestle, by grinding, crushing and pounding it.
HPS|0|6|3|0|When, in this way, you have obtained a reddish-brown powder, store it in a clean, dark glass container.
HPS|0|6|4|0|This medication is used in the same way as the first two kinds and its effect is also universal. But, above all, it is suitable for diseases of the lungs and also for sufferers from various kinds of bleeding.
HPS|0|6|5|0|If the blood, after it has been exposed several times, gives forth a most disagreeable smell, do not let it offend you, such a smell is not detrimental and finally, when the blood is quite dry, it changes to an actually pleasant smell.
HPS|0|6|6|0|However, you must not use blood of any other animal, also not the blood of cattle or sheep, for once these animals begin to feed on grass, the soul specifics in their blood become coarser and more impure and these would then absorb from the rays of the sun only what is homogeneous to them.
HPS|0|6|7|0|Therefore, the blood of lambs and calves, provided the animals are completely healthy, is only suitable for the abovementioned purpose while they still subsist on the milk of the mother.
HPS|0|6|8|0|This medication, if properly stored, retains its effectiveness for a whole year; after that it becomes less effective. It can be recharged by being exposed to the rays of the sun again for some time, yet it is better to prepare a fresh lot.
HPS|0|6|9|0|That is the fourth method. Now to another one.
HPS|0|7|1|1|A FIFTH METHOD OF USING THE SUNLIGHT FOR HEALING PURPOSES
HPS|0|7|1|0|As medicines for internal use, the first four mentioned types are quite sufficient, yet the sun-ray can be effectively used also in other ways for various ailments of the body.
HPS|0|7|2|0|For instance, if someone has an external cancerous wound, take a small so-called burning glass and pass it over the wound several times during the day in such a way that the focus passes over the entire wound. But the focus must not stay too long over any part of the wound.
HPS|0|7|3|0|After having passed the focus over a wound, dip a piece of linen in sunned water and place it on the wound. This has to be changed several times during an hour and – if a proper diet is adhered to – the sufferer will soon be healed.
HPS|0|7|4|0|If, instead of the cloth, you have good, ripe leaves of the tobacco plant available, they would be preferable; but they would first have to be calcined in the sun for a while, lying on a sheet of glass.
HPS|0|7|5|0|Instead of sunned water, a “sun-tincture” would be quite as effective. This is prepared as follows:
HPS|0|7|6|0|You are familiar with the alp flower “arnica”. Take of this flower only the yellow pistils and the pollen filaments, put 2 handfuls in ½ liter of good spirit of wine. This is to be exposed to the rays of the sun in a properly corked up bottle of light glass for 2-3 weeks and to be shaken several times during this period. After that the “sun tincture” would be ready and must be filtered off into a dark bottle and carefully stored.
HPS|0|7|7|0|When required, take 1 drop of this tincture to 1/5 of a liter of sunned water, with very big wounds 3-5 drops. Then a linen cloth, which first has to be warmed in the sun, is moistened with this mixture and placed on the wounds. Thereby, as well as with the previously mentioned two remedies, the wound will heal quickly.
HPS|0|7|8|0|Also venereal boils, herpes and scald heads can easily be healed with it, provided the inner diet is appropriate.
HPS|0|7|9|0|A further remedy for such malignant external wounds is as follows:
HPS|0|7|10|0|Take good hempseed, dry it in the sun for 14 days and store it in a dry place in tightly closed containers. When a need arises, put the hemp in an oil press after crushing it a bit. The result will be a rather refined oil.
HPS|0|7|11|0|Spread this oil repeatedly over such wounds, and if you keep a proper diet, they will heal within a short time without any harmful effect on the body.
HPS|0|7|12|0|From the thus treated hempseeds a kind of milk can also be prepared, similar to almond milk, which will be of great benefit to those who suffer from tuberculosis in the lungs, hardening of liver and spleen, as well as the kidneys. When this milk is taken, its beneficial effect upon these organs will be felt.
HPS|0|7|13|0|But where these inner parts are in danger of drying out, a milk from linseed, which would also have to be dried in the sun, would be preferable to hempseed milk.
HPS|0|7|14|0|Furthermore, there is a simple remedy for the relief of pains in the limbs.
HPS|0|7|15|0|Take freshly pressed olive oil, approximately 500 gr., fill it into a bottle with a good stopper and add a good handful of poppy petals. The petals of the wild or small field poppy are preferable to the large (filled) garden poppy.
HPS|0|7|16|0|When such poppy petals have been added to the oil, the bottle must be properly capped and also exposed to the sun for 2-3 weeks, frequently shaking it.
HPS|0|7|17|0|After this time, the oil must be poured into a preferably dark bottle which has to be well capped.
HPS|0|7|18|0|When someone suffers the above-mentioned pains, let him moisten a freshly sunned cloth with this oil and place it on the aching limb and he will soon feel relief. Also in cases of shooting pains in the chest and side, if they are of a rheumatic or arthritic nature, such oil can be applied with good results.
HPS|0|7|19|0|In the following, about some more arcana or main foods.
HPS|0|8|1|1|A SIXTH WAY OF USING THE SUNLIGHT FOR HEALING PURPOSES
HPS|0|8|1|0|Now let us pass to another, quite as effective, remedy.
HPS|0|8|2|0|Take skimmed goat’s milk, pour it into a glass cup similar to the one I described to you for the winning of sulfate crystals. If such a cup is hard to get, you may also use a square foot-size dark glass tablet.
HPS|0|8|3|0|Sprinkle the aforementioned milk upon it and expose it to the sun. The drops of milk will soon have dried.
HPS|0|8|4|0|When the first drops are dry, sprinkle again the milk upon the tablet and continue with this until quite a thick incrustation has formed on the tablet or on the bottom of the cup.
HPS|0|8|5|0|Then scrape this crust carefully from the tablet, pulverize it still more and keep the powder in a glass container, well protected from the effects of the air in a dry place.
HPS|0|8|6|0|At the same time put into a glass vessel, which must have a tight-fitting domed lid of identical glass, pure camphor scrapings, filling the vessel to half its capacity, and then place it, properly closed, in the sun, too. Thereby the actual camphor in the glass will decrease from day to day, but in the glass dome on top of it a whitish sediment will be forming.
HPS|0|8|7|0|When, because of the sediment, the glass dome is no longer transparent, take it down, put in the aforementioned milk powder and stir it until the milk powder has absorbed the sediment off the glass.
HPS|0|8|8|0|Store this powder carefully in suitable bottles. It is a principal life-remedy against all internal and external complaints stemming from plethora causing, in all parts of the body, swellings, inflammations and boils.
HPS|0|8|9|0|This remedy is also most effective for plague sufferers and will be excellent in cases of cholera.
HPS|0|8|10|0|Also sufferers from pulmonary diseases are easily cured by this remedy.
HPS|0|8|11|0|Thus, bad skin rashes, the shingles and scarlet fever are soon cured.
HPS|0|8|12|0|This remedy has a dual use. Take 1 to 3 grains (1 grain = 0.6 g); or if there are swellings (or tumors) on hands and feet, rub this powder into a clean, sunned cloth and put it dry on the swelling which will then soon dissolve. But it is advisable, depending on the nature, to take 1 to 3 grains as well.
HPS|0|8|13|0|This powder also possesses the property to revive a dying person for a longer period and sometimes, if it is not against My order, to heal him completely, whatever the illness which would have killed him if gross allopathic remedies would have been used. In the following, still another arcanum.
HPS|0|9|1|1|SOME FURTHER SUN REMEDIES
HPS|0|9|1|0|In addition to what I have already told you, I will give you some further medications, prepared through the rays of the sun, which are to be used externally rather than internally and which you may call sympathetic sunray remedies.
HPS|0|9|2|0|Take branches, including the bark, of a plum tree and burn them to ashes.
HPS|0|9|3|0|It would be best if you had a burning glass or a concave mirror in order to burn, in its focus, the plum tree wood, which would, of course, have to be cut into small chips, to ashes.
HPS|0|9|4|0|The ashes must then be exposed to the rays of the sun for 5 to 8 days, and that in a dark vessel rather than a light one.
HPS|0|9|5|0|After the ashes have thus been prepared through the rays of the sun they must, like the other medications, be carefully protected from the external air in a dry little bottle.
HPS|0|9|6|0|Someone with a decayed tooth can then take 5 to 8 grains of it, on a not too hard toothbrush which, prior to that, has to be dipped in sunned plum spirits.
HPS|0|9|7|0|With this ash, the decayed tooth has to be brushed for 3 days in the mornings and evenings and the decay will be healed and the tooth, finally, completely restored.
HPS|0|9|8|0|Similar ashes may be prepared also from the stalks of sage which have been treated in the same way, except that the toothbrush is not dipped in plum spirits, but in spirits of wine of approximately 40%, after this has been impregnated with etheric oils of sage.
HPS|0|9|9|0|To impregnate the spirits of wine with the etheric oils of sage, add 10 drops of this oil to 1/8 of a pint, the little bottle is plugged up, the contents shaken and then exposed to the rays of the sun for 5-8 days. Then the bottle is wrapped in dark paper and stored in a dry place.
HPS|0|10|1|1|A SUN REMEDY AGAINST CHOLERA
HPS|0|10|1|0|Gather fresh juniper berries at the time when they are beginning to turn blue and clean them of any needles.
HPS|0|10|2|0|Then take a blue linen cloth and lay it in a dry spot where the sun is shining; on an old wooden table would be best. Then spread the gathered berries over this cloth so that none of the berries are covered by another.
HPS|0|10|3|0|At the time the sun is getting a little weaker, the effect of its rays can be enhanced by erecting a high white wall next to the table opposite the sun. This is simple enough to do by hanging up a white linen sheet.
HPS|0|10|4|0|In the evening, the blue cloth is grasped by its four corners and the berries placed in a glass bottle big enough to accommodate both cloth and berries. Then the bottle is covered as well as possible for the night.
HPS|0|10|5|0|The berries are exposed to the sun until their surface is shriveled up like pepper. Then they may be stored in the same bottle, but without the cloth, for future use, but the bottle must be well plugged and kept in a dry place. Prepared in this way, the berries can be kept for years without losing their power.
HPS|0|10|6|0|If the above-mentioned disease is raging somewhere, eat 3-7 of such berries in the morning; also pulverize some berries and fumigate the rooms with them and also the clothes you wear when going out. Then, however bad the epidemic may be, the one who uses this remedy, believing and trusting in Me, adhering to a diet, abstaining from sexual intercourse and other indulgences, will be completely safe.
HPS|0|10|7|0|Such berries, boiled in a pint of pure spring water at medium heat and afterwards drunk, that is, only the water, will, in a short time, cure a person who has caught the cholera.
HPS|0|10|8|0|Boiled in some wine and water this juniper berry tea also cures the plague, provided the disease is still in the early stages. The drinking of this tea also heals the troublesome dropsy better than any other remedy. But with dropsy it is better to use only water and not add any wine.
HPS|0|10|9|0|Against cholera I can tell you also another remedy.
HPS|0|10|10|0|Gather the small field chamomile, but use only the white flower and the yellow pollen. Put this into a bottle of white glass (the plant must not be green), cork it up and expose it to the sun until its contents are almost completely dry. Then put it in the same bottle in a dry place.
HPS|0|10|11|0|If someone catches the cholera, take a good tablespoonful of these flowers, put them in a cup and pour 1/8 of a liter of pure boiling water over it and cover the cup properly for 12 minutes. Then strain the tea, give it to the patient and keep him warm in his bed, and he will soon recover.
HPS|0|10|12|0|If available, add to the tea 1-2 grains of castor powder (castoreum sibiricum) which will enhance the effect of the tea. But the castor tincture is not advisable… except when this would consist of juniper brandy four times distilled, to which, for this purpose, one would have to add a half lot [old German weight unit [1 hundredweight (100 pounds) = 56 kg 1 pound (32 lots) = 560 g 1 lot (4 quintels) = 17.5 g 1 quintel (60 grans) = 4.4 g 1 grans = 73 mg. The exact values result from the ratio: 1 quintel = 4.375467 g.] of castor powder per half seidel [old liquid measure in Austria until 1875: 1 seidel = 0.354 liter; in Bavaria until 1871: 1 seidel = 0.535 liter].
HPS|0|10|13|0|After that, the bottle would have to be well corked and exposed to the sunrays until such spirits would take on a quite dark reddish-brownish color. Seven to ten drops of such tincture would then have to be added to a cup containing ¾ of a seidel of the above-mentioned chamomile tea, whereby the evil would then be cured in a few minutes.
HPS|0|10|14|0|Here, now you have the best remedies against cholera.
HPS|0|10|15|0|But in the near future, I will yet give you several remedies against the Black Death and the so-called yellow fever.
HPS|0|11|1|1|A SUN REMEDY AGAINST PESTILENCE AND YELLOW FEVER
HPS|0|11|1|0|Already since your years of childhood, you have known a root, and this one is nothing different than the true Asian rhubarb.
HPS|0|11|2|0|There is an abundant healing power in the real rhubarb, even when one takes it in its raw state either as a powder or in little pieces (but then of course somewhat chewed up in the mouth). But the healing power proves to be of even greater value when this root is prepared in the following way:
HPS|0|11|3|0|Take a few lots of this root and grind them, but not too fine; expose this powder to the sunrays in the already familiar way in a container adequate for this and cover it at nighttime with a pure, black  lambskin which one can also expose to the sunrays during the day, namely the coarse, woolen side.
HPS|0|11|4|0|But the wool should not get too close to the powder. It is best to cut a square piece out of the lambskin that is just as wide as the container (cup) and to then glue it with the smooth side of the skin to a small square board. Should the skin have wool that is a little bit too long, you trim it with scissors and then clean the fur thoroughly with a brush.
HPS|0|11|5|0|If the sun is strong, eight to ten days of exposure are enough; but if it is weaker, the time of exposure should be doubled.
HPS|0|11|6|0|On days when a northern wind blows, the powder can also be set out in the open air, even if, because of dense fog drifts, the sun cannot always shine on the powder. In this case, the northern air is of the same value as the sunray.
HPS|0|11|7|0|When the above-mentioned powder has been prepared, it then has to be stored in the same way as the earlier medicaments. It is good to wrap the storage container in the same lambskin with which you covered the powder before at nighttime.
HPS|0|11|8|0|In this way, now you have a main medicament that brings reliable healing of almost all diseases when 7 to 10 gran are taken in the morning and in the evening, unless the disease has already reached the end stage.
HPS|0|11|9|0|If the Black Death or yellow fever are spreading somewhere, this powder, when taken early enough and always a ½ lot, will bring a fast and complete cure; but if this remedy is taken too late, which can happen very easily with these diseases because they usually take a fast course, it would of course not achieve much.
HPS|0|11|10|0|For this case, I want to show you another root which is found in the higher mountains of Asia. This root also grows in the lower regions, but then it has a little bit of a yellow look and is not as robust as the white one. Its name is Jaisung and sometimes it is also called Jensing (Ginseng).
HPS|0|11|11|0|This root is being prepared as the rhubarb, but it has to be taken in a five times lower dose than the rhubarb.
HPS|0|11|12|0|In a relatively stronger dose it cures the Black Death and yellow fever like no other remedy, often still even in the third stage. Particularly in the case of the Black Death, it still has to be mentioned that the rooms of such patients have to be fumigated several times a day with shaved fenugreek and juniper berries. If the malady is very rampant, it also has a good effect to place one or two billy goats in the sickroom.
HPS|0|11|13|0|Therefore, if you follow all of this, even if this Black Death is intensely rampant in a place, this will keep it away from such a house. And if the fumigations are being used in general, it will completely disappear within three days at the longest.
HPS|0|11|14|0|In case this malady is extraordinarily intense, a little bit of the rhubarb powder can also be added to the incense.
HPS|0|11|15|0|With this, you thus have the promised remedies for the two most deadly evils on this earth.
HPS|0|11|16|0|The use of rhubarb powder as well as of Jensing is mainly and preferably recommended for the recovery of very weakened, often totally dried up nerves as well as also against all maladies which arise from a certain epidemic.
HPS|0|11|17|0|Here in Graz, it will be very difficult for you to get genuine Jensing; but in Trieste, Paris, London, also in Hamburg, the genuine root can be bought, however at an almost unaffordably high price.
HPS|0|11|18|0|The American Jensing root, which is five times weaker, acts in the same way when taken in a larger dose. It is found in America in the South and in the North. The Southern one is better than the Northern one.
HPS|0|12|1|1|A REMEDY FOR THE GROWTH OF HAIR
HPS|0|12|1|0|On September 21, 1840 Jakob Lorber approached the Lord for a remedy for the growth of hair, and that at the request of And.H.
HPS|0|12|2|0|Recipe / finest, odorless oil of sunflowers: 1 pound / fluid  goose grease: 4 lots / neck grease: 4 lots / fluid storax: 1 lot / egg oil: ½ lot / neroli oil: ½ lot / truly genuine thyme oil: 1 lot / truly genuine Peruvian balm: 1 dram / genuine rose oil: ¼ dram / also add cocoa butter as well: 1 lot.
HPS|0|12|3|0|These 10 species have to be blended well in a bottle and applied in the morning and evening continuously. Now and then the head should also be washed with lukewarm water, then--well dried--again be anointed with this oil ointment; thus the hair will grow again, especially if in addition some sexual abstinence could be observed for a longer period of at least 3 months; and, but also preferably: Spero in te, Domine, in omnibus rebus, quoniam tu solus sanctus, amore plenus, peramabilis, peradjuvabilis et omnipotens es, - - - Fiat Dixit Dominus [In everything, I trust in You, Lord, for You alone are holy, full of love, highly adorable, helpful and almighty. - - - It shall be, said the Lord.
